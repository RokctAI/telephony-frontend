# Compose this Next.js shell from its committed SDK cache.
#
# Ray's standing ruling for Next.js shells (2026-09-03): the shell commits
# its SDK cache under .rokct/cache/ and composes from that committed cache
# at build time; the composed output the installers write into the host
# stays gitignored. This is the Dart app shells' model (paas_manager,
# paas_driver both track .rokct/cache/) applied to a Next.js shell: Vercel
# builds from a commit, so everything the build composes from has to be in
# the commit - no token, no clone, no second place holding a secret.
#
#   bash scripts/compose.sh            offline mode (default) - what Vercel
#                                      runs (vercel.json buildCommand), what
#                                      CI runs, what a developer runs. Composes
#                                      ONLY from the committed .rokct/cache/.
#                                      No git, no network, no token. Every SDK
#                                      listed in .rokct/lock.json must be
#                                      present in the cache and match its pins,
#                                      or this exits non-zero before running
#                                      any installer.

#                                      MONOREPO_PAT. Re-fetches the
#                                      protocol composer and every SDK named by
#                                      the registry template
#                                      (.rokct/config/app_type ->
#                                      core/utils/frappe/composer/<app_type>.json),
#                                      replaces .rokct/cache/<sdk>/ wholesale,
#                                      rewrites .rokct/lock.json (every SDK's
#                                      pins and its home_sdk flag), the
#                                      composed-output block in .gitignore and
#                                      (only when a dependency changed)
#                                      package-lock.json, and stages the cache.
#                                      Commit the result to main; that commit
#                                      is what triggers the Vercel build.
#
# .rokct/cache/ is listed in the root .gitignore and committed anyway with
# `git add -f` (the refresh does this for you). The ignore rule exists only to
# keep the fleet linter's `prettier --write . --ignore-path .gitignore` pass
# off the vendored templates: reformatting one would change the cache content
# the lock pins, and the next Vercel build would refuse to compose.
#
# The composer itself is The-Rokct-Protocol's core/utils/nextjs/sdk_composer.py
# and sdk_installer_base.py. Refresh vendors both into .rokct/cache/_composer/
# and pins them in lock.json; offline mode verifies those pins before
# importing anything - the same fetch-then-verify rule protocol.lock.json
# applies to every executed file.
#
# Environment (refresh only):
#   MONOREPO_PAT                 token for the private SDK repos; the composer
#                                injects it into clone URLs (see
#                                authenticated_git_url). Never set on Vercel.
#   ROKCT_PROTOCOL_REF           protocol ref to vendor the composer from
#                                (default main)
#   ROKCT_REFRESH_ALLOW_SIBLINGS set to 1 to let the composer read an SDK from
#                                a sibling checkout (../core next to this
#                                repo) instead of cloning. Off by default:
#                                the sibling path skips the composer's sha256
#                                pin gate and would pin lock.json to whatever
#                                that checkout happens to be at.
