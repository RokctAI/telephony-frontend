// Tenant-link registry for the credentials flow (./auth.ts, ./actions.ts).
//
// A "tenant link" is the answer to three questions the login and register
// paths ask that have nothing to do with authenticating anybody:
//
//   1. WHICH tenant site does this email sign in against, when the form did
//      not name one? (./auth.ts, before the gateway login call.)
//   2. WHERE do the keys and site this login produced get remembered?
//      (./auth.ts, after it.)
//   3. Under WHICH platform administrator does a registration provision?
//      (Since 1.7.0 a home SDK's register provisioner, ./register-provision.ts,
//      asks this; auth_sdk's own default provisions nothing. The register
//      write itself, linkRegistration(), stayed auth's own: ./register-link.ts,
//      after ANY provisioner succeeds.)
//
// Until now there was exactly one answer to all three: the local Postgres
// store this SDK installs (db/, lib/drizzle/). That store is a
// MULTI-TENANCY feature, not an auth feature - it maps a user to the base
// URL they came from - and a deployment that serves many tenant backends
// genuinely needs it: rokctai_frontend reads it on every login and migrates
// it before `next build`.
//
// A shell dedicated to ONE tenant has nothing to map. It knows its backend
// from its own environment, and asking it to run a Postgres instance so the
// login form can look up an answer it already has is a database it keeps
// only to ignore. Worse, the lookup sat in the `try` of the block whose
// `catch` returns `null`, so on a shell with no database configured every
// login failed as "invalid credentials" - the misconfiguration was invisible.
//
// So the three operations get a seam. An SDK installs a module whose default
// export is a TenantLink and registers it with ONE line at the marker below
// through its manifest integrations:
//
//   { id: "<sdk>-tenant-link", load: () => import("@/app/(auth)/<file>") },
//
// [loadTenantLink] answers the FIRST entry that loads (one shell, one link,
// exactly as base_sdk's ./hero-form.ts picks one form and its
// ./plans-query.ts picks one query). With NOTHING registered the loop does
// not run and the answer is the built-in named by ROKCT_TENANT_LINK, whose
// default is "database" - the drizzle-backed implementation that is this
// file's whole reason for existing in the first place, behaviour-identical
// to the inline code it replaced. rokctai_frontend sets no such variable and
// registers nothing, so it reads and writes Postgres exactly as before.
//
// A single-tenant shell that composes no SDK of its own selects the other
// built-in with one committed line of config instead - `env: {
// ROKCT_TENANT_LINK: "single-tenant" }` in its own next.config.mjs, which is
// host-owned and therefore survives a compose (an SDK-installed file does
// not: scripts/compose.sh reconcile_tracked_host_files() documents that the
// SDK copy wins at build time). See ./tenant-link-single.ts.
//
// Entries between the markers below are injected by the Rokct SDK installer
// (sdk_installer_base.py update_integrations()) - the same contract as
// base_sdk's landing registries, and ONE marker in this file for the same
// reason those carry one each: the installer anchors successive entries for
// a target file after the previous entry, whichever marker they named, so a
// second marker in the same file is silently never injected into. An entry
// is a single self-contained line with a dynamic import (no import statement
// of its own). Do not remove or reformat the marker comments inside the
// array literal.
