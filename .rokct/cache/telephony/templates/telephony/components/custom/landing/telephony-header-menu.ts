// The telephony storefront's header menu, for base_sdk's header-menu registry
// (components/custom/landing/header-menu.ts, base_sdk >= 1.14.0), which the
// shared header renders inside itself: inline beside the logo from the `lg`
// breakpoint up, behind a burger below it.
//
// Flat entries only, as hosting-header-menu.ts. The two are ANCHORS, not
// links: telephony-features-section.tsx and telephony-pricing-section.tsx
// register their own `{ id, label }` in meta.nav, base resolves each id
// against the page's live nav, lifts the label from there, and drops the
// entry on a render where the section is not on the page (the pricing
// section turns itself down when the platform returns no plan rows), which
// a hand-written "#pricing" href could not do. No groups: a storefront for
// one product has no product panel. No `actions`: the header already draws
// Log in and Sign up beside the row (components/custom/header.tsx, the auth
// link and the auth pill), and a second pair would only repeat them.
//
// `brand: { logo: "none" }` (base_sdk >= 1.21.0's HeaderMenu.brand): the
// home SDK declares whether the header shows a logo (Ray, 2026-09-09,
// 14:15Z), and no telephony artwork exists in any source, so the header
// draws no image and the wordmark (the host's branding.tsx) is the logo.
// `wordmark` is left at its default, true. Against a base_sdk older than
// 1.21.0 the field is unknown to the registry's HeaderMenu type and the
// compose fails to type-check, which is the floor the manifest names.

import type { HeaderMenu } from "@/components/custom/landing/header-menu";

  // No telephony icon yet: the wordmark alone (Ray, 2026-09-09).
