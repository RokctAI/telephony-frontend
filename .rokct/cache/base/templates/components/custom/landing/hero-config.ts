// Copy and chrome for the generic landing hero (components/custom/hero.tsx).
//
// The hero itself knows nothing about any product feature: everything a
// host wants to say on it lives here, and everything a feature SDK wants to
// add to it (a results panel under the input, extra headline words) arrives
// through the section registry in ./hero-sections.ts. The words below are
// the DEFAULT (rokctapp's): a product whose shell is thin - installed files
// regenerated on every compose, so an edit here does not last - has its
// home SDK register its own copy in ./hero-copy.ts, which the hero lays
// over this config field by field.
//
// Since 1.23.0 the defaults name NO third-party asset (Ray, 2026-09-09:
// "everything served from another company cdn tells you is placeholder"):
// the gradient behind the hero, the Chrome Web Store and Google Play icons
// hotlinked from a chat template's CDN and the "Trusted by 20M+ users"
// claim are gone. The background is empty (the hero hides the block), the
// trust line is empty (the network strip is what stands under the hero
// now), the Chrome badge draws lucide's own Chrome mark as the header's
// extension button does, and the Google Play badge has no icon - a badge
// without one is not drawn until a home SDK's hero copy gives it one.
