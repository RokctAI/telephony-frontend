// Section registry for the generic landing host
// (components/custom/landing-content.tsx).
//
// base_sdk holds only the host: the page, the orchestrator, this registry
// and the hero. Every content section of the page belongs to the home SDK
// of the app being composed (agent_sdk for rokctapp: its floating nav,
// logos, chat, social, features, workflow, pricing, comparison, faq and
// testimonials sections), the way a Dart home SDK holds its own profile
// screens. The orchestrator renders each registered module's default export
// with PageSectionProps, in ascending `meta.order` (registry order breaks
// ties); a module's `meta.nav` adds its floating-nav entries, and its
// optional `meta.renders` says whether the section belongs on this page at
// all - a section it turns down is neither rendered nor listed in the nav.
// A shell composed with no registered section renders the hero alone.
//
// Entries between the markers below are injected by the Rokct SDK installer
// (sdk_installer_base.py update_integrations()) - the same contract as the
// hero registry in ./hero-sections.ts, the nav marker in
// app/handson/sidebar-client.tsx and the flag marker in
// app/config/compose.ts. An installed SDK's manifest declares one line per
// section, inserted immediately after the start marker:
//
//   { id: "<file>", load: () => import("@/components/custom/<file>") },
//
// The entry is a dynamic import on purpose: the installer injects lines at
// ONE marker per file (update_integrations() anchors successive entries
// for a target file after the previous entry, whichever marker they named),
// so a contribution must be a single self-contained line with no import
// statement of its own - which is also why this registry is a separate file
// from the hero's. It also means a section is only bundled when it is
// registered, and that a shell composed without the SDK never references
// the missing module. Do not remove or reformat the marker comments inside
// the array literal.
