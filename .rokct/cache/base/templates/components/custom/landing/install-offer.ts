// The install offer's rules (since 1.41.0), the pure half of
// components/custom/install-offer.tsx. Ray, 2026-09-11: "this nextjs has
// install, it does show on mobile though i havent seen it in desktop i
// think it installs as pwa but i think it should check the platform and
// offer app of that platform". So: read the platform the visitor is on
// ([detectPlatform]), pick the download the shell declared for it
// ([pickDownload]), and beside it - since 1.46.0, whether or not one is
// declared - the browser's own install prompt as an action of ours. No
// user-agent string, platform name or store is known here beyond the
// tokens the detection reads; the entries and every word on screen
// arrive from the home SDK.
//
// Since 1.46.0 this module also holds the OFFERED-DOWNLOAD STORE and
// [visibleDownloads] (Ray, 2026-09-11 20:33:16Z: the icon buttons "become
// double when you tell user to download for that platform, i think should
// hide the normal one when showing the other"): the offer publishes the
// id of the entry it is showing, and the icon row
// (components/custom/download-buttons.tsx) drops that one entry after
// mount. A plain subscribe/get/set store, no DOM, so a server render and
// the first client render read `null` and draw every icon.

 * store is the one to offer first; [pickDownload] falls back to Android
 * for it), Android before Linux (an Android string says "Linux"), and
 * Windows before all of those bar iOS (no string of theirs says "Win").
 * A string that names none of them is `null`, not "web": the offer then
 * has nothing to pick and falls back to the browser's install prompt.
