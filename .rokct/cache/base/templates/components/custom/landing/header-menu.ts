// Header-menu registry for the generic landing host
// (components/custom/landing-content.tsx).
//
// Ray, looking at the live site: "menus in header and footer are not
// injected". The footer half a home SDK can already answer by itself - its
// own footer section owns that markup, the way lms_sdk's
// lms-footer-section.tsx renders its own link row. The HEADER half it
// cannot: a home SDK has nowhere to put a header link, because the header
// is generic chrome every shell shares (base_sdk ships
// components/custom/header.tsx since 1.14.0; before that it was the host
// shell's own `requires` file). The landing host is the one thing that
// renders that header, so the seam belongs here.
//
// A home SDK installs a module whose default export is a HeaderMenu and
// registers it with ONE line at the marker below through its manifest
// integrations:
//
//   { id: "<sdk>-header-menu", load: () => import("@/components/custom/landing/<file>") },
//
// [loadHeaderMenu] answers the FIRST entry that loads (one page, one header
// menu, exactly as ./hero-form.ts picks one form and ./plans-query.ts picks
// one query). With NOTHING registered it answers `null`, the resolved menu
// is empty and the header (components/custom/header.tsx, shipped by
// base_sdk since 1.14.0) renders no navigation at all: logo, theme toggle
// and the auth links only.
//
// Since 1.14.0 the menu lives INSIDE that header - inline beside the logo
// from the `lg` breakpoint up, behind a burger button below it - rather
// than in a row under the host's own header, and a HeaderMenu may also
// name `groups` and `actions` (call-to-action buttons at the right-hand end
// of the bar).
//
// Since 1.18.0 the groups open as ONE panel, the way rokct.ai's hand-written
// header did before base shipped one (Ray, 2026-09-09: "no mega menu
// anymore" is a regression; rokct keeps everything its old header had). The
// FIRST group is the panel's lead: its label is the word on the single
// desktop trigger and its items form the panel's first column, without a
// repeated heading; every group after it is a headed column beside it. An
// item may carry a `description` and an `icon`, and one that does renders
// as a card (icon box, label, blurb) rather than a bare link - the three
// platform cards of rokct.ai's Product panel. A menu with no groups renders
// exactly as it did in 1.16.0.
//
// Since 1.21.0 the menu also carries the BRAND declaration (Ray,
// 2026-09-09: "i saw supacharge got a s logo in header, let home sdk
// declare if it needs logo there or not. supacharge text is the logo right
// now until i design an icon"). The header draws the host shell's own
// brand-logo.tsx beside the wordmark, and a shell with no icon of its own
// draws a placeholder there - supacharge-web's is the platform's first
// letter on a dark square, the "S" Ray saw. `brand.logo` lets the home SDK
// say what belongs in that slot: "none" (the wordmark IS the logo), a path
// to a real image, or "auto" (the default: the copy's registered `icon`
// from ./site-metadata.ts when there is one, else the host's own mark).
// The generated /brand-icon letter tile (app/brand-icon/route.tsx) is for
// the browser tab and the share card only and is never drawn here, not
// even when named. [resolveHeaderBrand] is the pure rule and
// [loadHeaderBrand] the loader the header renders through.
//
// Since 1.24.0 the brand declaration also says whether the host's mark
// draws its badge (`badge`: rokct.ai's BETA strip) and whether the brand
// COLLAPSES the way rokct.ai's old header did (`collapse`: the large
// wordmark slides away after load, the mark keeps the visitor's country
// code and a chevron, and the desktop nav fades until the pointer is over
// the bar or the page is scrolled). Ray, 2026-09-09: rokct.ai keeps
// everything its old host header had; a shell that declares neither draws
// the still brand it drew before. An action may also be `secondary`, the
// filled muted button that header drew its "Chat with ROK" as.
//
// Since 1.25.0 an action's icon may also be an IMAGE the shell serves
// itself (`{ src, alt }`, the shape a hero badge's icon takes) beside the
// named glyphs. Ray, 2026-09-09, on the Chrome Web Store mark rokct.ai's
// old header hot-linked from a third party's CDN: "use it but bring it
// local" - so the home SDK installs the file under public/ and names its
// path here; base never names a third-party host.
//
// Since 1.28.0 a collapsing brand that declares NO image (`logo: "none"`,
// the wordmark is the logo) folds into a letter tile rather than into
// nothing (Ray, 2026-09-10, on supacharge.app: "rokctai has logo and name
// that the name fold into logo and menus disapear, this is not in
// supacharge. since supacharge has not icon cant it fold and only leave the
// first letter as its icon?"). The tile is the header's own CSS - the
// first letter of the platform name, [brandLetterOf], in the shell's
// primary colour on the same dark ground the generated /brand-icon tab
// tile draws - and it exists only while the brand is collapsed; the still
// brand of a shell that declares no `collapse` is byte-for-byte what it
// was, and a declared image or the host's mark still folds to that image.
//
// Since 1.29.0 that same icon-less collapsing brand folds differently when
// the platform name carries a DOT (Ray, 2026-09-10: "if sitename has a
// dot, fold dot and what comes after so the s will never show anymore
// unless there is icon, if there is icon it fold further to leave only
// icon"): the dot and everything after it slide away and the text before
// the first dot, [brandStemOf], stays as the wordmark - the letter tile is
// never drawn for a dotted name. [brandFoldsToStem] is the rule. A brand
// with an image keeps folding to that image whatever its name, and an
// undotted icon-less name keeps the 1.28.0 tile.
//
// Since 1.31.0 the country code beside a stem wordmark follows the stem's
// size ([BRAND_STEM_CODE_FONT_SIZE]): the 36px it has beside a mark, or
// the stem's own size where that is smaller, so on a phone the code is
// never larger than the wordmark it sits beside - as it never is beside
// rokct.ai's fixed 44px mark. The code beside a mark or a tile is
// unchanged.
//
// Since 1.36.0 a group may lay its items out in ONE ROW (`layout: "row"`)
// instead of a column, and the menu may name the trigger's word itself
// (`megaLabel`) rather than take the first group's label (Ray, 2026-09-10,
// on supacharge: "header app links first. if possible put mobile apps in
// one row since supa dont have much menu"). The apps group goes first,
// its cards side by side across a wider lead column, and the bar still
// reads the word the shell declares. Also since 1.36.0 the code beside a
// STEM wordmark is capped at the size rokct.ai's original header gave
// its code: the superscript scale of its branding, [BRAND_CODE_SCALE],
// of the 44px mark ([BRAND_CODE_FONT_SIZE], about 12px) - the 36px was
// that header's fallback for a cache with no style, never what rokct
// rendered (Ray, 2026-09-10: "za in supa is big, look at one in rokct,
// original one"). The code beside a mark or a tile is untouched, so
// rokct.ai renders exactly as it did; beside a stem the code still
// follows the stem down ([BRAND_STEM_CODE_FONT_SIZE]) so it never
// outgrows the wordmark.
//
// Entries between the markers below are injected by the Rokct SDK installer
// (sdk_installer_base.py update_integrations()) - the same contract as
// ./hero-sections.ts, ./hero-copy.ts, ./hero-form.ts, ./plans-query.ts and
// ./page-sections.ts, and a separate file for the same reason those are:
// the installer anchors successive entries for a target file after the
// previous entry, whichever marker they named, so one file carries one
// marker and an entry is a single self-contained line with a dynamic import
// (no import statement of its own). Do not remove or reformat the marker
// comments inside the array literal.
