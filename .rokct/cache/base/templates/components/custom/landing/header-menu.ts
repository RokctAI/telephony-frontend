// Header-menu registry for the generic landing host
// (components/custom/landing-content.tsx).
//
// Ray, looking at the live site: "menus in header and footer are not
// injected". The footer half a home SDK can already answer by itself - its
// own footer section owns that markup, the way lms_sdk's
// lms-footer-section.tsx renders its own link row. The HEADER half it
// cannot: a home SDK has nowhere to put a header link, because the header
// is generic chrome every shell shares (base_sdk ships
// components/custom/header.tsx since 1.14.0; before that it was the host
// shell's own `requires` file). The landing host is the one thing that
// renders that header, so the seam belongs here.
//
// A home SDK installs a module whose default export is a HeaderMenu and
// registers it with ONE line at the marker below through its manifest
// integrations:
//
//   { id: "<sdk>-header-menu", load: () => import("@/components/custom/landing/<file>") },
//
// [loadHeaderMenu] answers the FIRST entry that loads (one page, one header
// menu, exactly as ./hero-form.ts picks one form and ./plans-query.ts picks
// one query). With NOTHING registered it answers `null`, the resolved menu
// is empty and the header (components/custom/header.tsx, shipped by
// base_sdk since 1.14.0) renders no navigation at all: logo, theme toggle
// and the auth links only.
//
// Since 1.14.0 the menu lives INSIDE that header - inline beside the logo
// from the `lg` breakpoint up, behind a burger button below it - rather
// than in a row under the host's own header, and a HeaderMenu may also
// name `groups` and `actions` (call-to-action buttons at the right-hand end
// of the bar).
//
// Since 1.18.0 the groups open as ONE panel, the way rokct.ai's hand-written
// header did before base shipped one (Ray, 2026-09-09: "no mega menu
// anymore" is a regression; rokct keeps everything its old header had). The
// FIRST group is the panel's lead: its label is the word on the single
// desktop trigger and its items form the panel's first column, without a
// repeated heading; every group after it is a headed column beside it. An
// item may carry a `description` and an `icon`, and one that does renders
// as a card (icon box, label, blurb) rather than a bare link - the three
// platform cards of rokct.ai's Product panel. A menu with no groups renders
// exactly as it did in 1.16.0.
//
// Since 1.21.0 the menu also carries the BRAND declaration (Ray,
// 2026-09-09: "i saw supacharge got a s logo in header, let home sdk
// declare if it needs logo there or not. supacharge text is the logo right
// now until i design an icon"). The header draws the host shell's own
// brand-logo.tsx beside the wordmark, and a shell with no icon of its own
// draws a placeholder there - supacharge-web's is the platform's first
// letter on a dark square, the "S" Ray saw. `brand.logo` lets the home SDK
// say what belongs in that slot: "none" (the wordmark IS the logo), a path
// to a real image, or "auto" (the default: the copy's registered `icon`
// from ./site-metadata.ts when there is one, else the host's own mark).
// The generated /brand-icon letter tile (app/brand-icon/route.tsx) is for
// the browser tab and the share card only and is never drawn here, not
// even when named. [resolveHeaderBrand] is the pure rule and
// [loadHeaderBrand] the loader the header renders through.
//
// Entries between the markers below are injected by the Rokct SDK installer
// (sdk_installer_base.py update_integrations()) - the same contract as
// ./hero-sections.ts, ./hero-copy.ts, ./hero-form.ts, ./plans-query.ts and
// ./page-sections.ts, and a separate file for the same reason those are:
// the installer anchors successive entries for a target file after the
// previous entry, whichever marker they named, so one file carries one
// marker and an entry is a single self-contained line with a dynamic import
// (no import statement of its own). Do not remove or reformat the marker
// comments inside the array literal.
