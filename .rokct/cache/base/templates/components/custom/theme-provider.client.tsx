/**
 * The client half of the shell's theme seam (since base_sdk 1.35.0 the
 * entry, ./theme-provider.tsx, is a server component that renders this
 * and, before it, the data/theme.json colour block; the next-themes
 * provider needs the client, so it lives here - the same split as a
 * landing section's entry and its <name>.client.tsx). Shipped by base_sdk
 * since 1.22.0.
 *
 * Ray, 2026-09-09: "default to dark mode". Until then every shell carried
 * its own copy of this file (a bare pass-through for next-themes' props)
 * and its root layout chose the default on its own, which is how one shell
 * came to open dark and the other to follow the visitor's OS. The rule
 * lives here, once, for every shell the composer lands it on:
 *
 * - `defaultTheme` is DARK. A first visit with NO stored preference paints
 *   dark whatever the OS says. A preference the visitor already expressed
 *   through the header's toggle (next-themes keeps it under the `theme`
 *   key in localStorage) is honoured exactly as before, and the toggle keeps
 *   flipping between light and dark.
 * - `attribute` is "class", the signal Tailwind's `darkMode: ["class"]`
 *   reads, so the `dark:` variants across the composed pages stay live.
 * - Everything else (`enableSystem`, `disableTransitionOnChange`, `storageKey`
 *   and the rest) is next-themes' own default unless the host passes it.
 *   With `enableSystem` on, "system" remains a value a toggle may select;
 *   it is only no longer what an unexpressed preference resolves to.
 *
 * A host layout may still pass `defaultTheme`, but the platform rule is dark
 * and a layout that passes "light" or "system" is overriding it (the
 * manifest's app/layout.tsx note states the contract). The props type comes
 * from the "next-themes" package root: next-themes 0.4.x ships no
 * `dist/types` entry point.
