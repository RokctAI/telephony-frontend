// The site header every rokct shell renders: ONE component, shipped by
// base_sdk since 1.14.0, with the menu INSIDE it.
//
// Ray, 2026-09-09: rokct.ai and supacharge.app must use the same header,
// links inline on desktop, and on a phone the menu must not show in the
// header at all except behind a burger. So:
//
//  - from the `lg` breakpoint up the bar is logo | section links and the
//    groups' one trigger (nav[aria-label="Sections"]; since 1.18.0 it opens
//    ONE panel the width of the bar, anchored under it - the bar's
//    backdrop-filter is that panel's containing block) | actions, theme
//    toggle, auth - rokctai_frontend's chrome (fixed-height bar, blurred
//    translucent ground, mega-menu hover) as the reference;
//  - below `lg` the bar is logo | burger, nothing else: the links, the
//    groups, the actions, the theme toggle and the auth buttons all sit in
//    a full-screen panel under the bar that the burger opens. The panel
//    closes on a tap on any of its links, on Escape, on a route change and
//    on the burger again, and the page behind it does not scroll while it
//    is open.
//
// Generic chrome: the words come resolved from
// components/custom/landing/header-menu.ts (a home SDK registers them; see
// that file), the brand from the host's own brand-logo.tsx / branding.tsx
// and the theme control from its theme-toggle.tsx (all three `requires`
// files, so each shell keeps its mark and its toggle), and the colours are
// the shell's theme tokens - background, foreground, border, primary - so
// rokct.ai renders it in its palette and Supacharge in its own without
// either editing this file.
//
// Since 1.21.0 the home SDK says what the brand slot draws (Ray,
// 2026-09-09: "i saw supacharge got a s logo in header, let home sdk
// declare if it needs logo there or not. supacharge text is the logo right
// now until i design an icon"). The menu's `brand.logo` is "none" (no
// image, the wordmark is the logo), a path (that image) or "auto" (a real
// icon: the copy's registered `icon`, else the host's own brand-logo.tsx -
// the mark every shell drew before, so nothing declared draws what it drew
// before). The declaration is loaded through next/dynamic, the way the
// hero loads its form, so the first paint on the server already carries
// the right mark and the "S" never flashes. The generated /brand-icon
// letter tile is for the tab and the share card and is never drawn here.
//
// Since 1.24.0 the declaration may also switch on the two things rokct.ai's
// old header did with its brand that 1.21.0 dropped (Ray, 2026-09-09:
// "header lost functions the old rokct header had"; rokct.ai keeps
// everything its old host header had): `brand.badge` draws the host's mark
// with its badge (rokct.ai's BETA strip), and `brand.collapse` is the
// collapsing brand - 44px mark and a large wordmark that slides away after
// load, leaving the mark, the visitor's country code and a chevron, while
// the desktop nav fades until the pointer is over the bar or the page is
// scrolled. Both are off unless declared, so a shell that registers
// neither (Supacharge) renders byte-for-byte what it did.
//
// Since 1.28.0 a collapsing brand with NO image (`logo: "none"`) folds
// into a letter tile rather than into nothing (Ray, 2026-09-10: "since
// supacharge has not icon cant it fold and only leave the first letter as
// its icon?"): [BrandLetterTile], the platform name's first letter in the
// shell's primary colour on the dark ground the generated /brand-icon tab
// tile uses, 44px like a mark, drawn in CSS - no image, no fetch - and
// only while the brand is collapsed. The still brand, a declared image and
// the host's own mark are untouched; a shell that declares no `collapse`
// renders exactly what it rendered.
//
// Since 1.29.0 an icon-less collapsing brand whose platform name carries a
// dot folds to its STEM instead (Ray, 2026-09-10: "if sitename has a dot,
// fold dot and what comes after so the s will never show anymore unless
// there is icon, if there is icon it fold further to leave only icon"):
// [BrandStemWordmark] draws the whole name at load in the large
// wordmark's classes and after `delayMs` slides the dot and what follows
// it away, leaving the text before the first dot as the wordmark with the
// code and the chevron beside it. The letter tile is never drawn for a
// dotted name; a brand with an image still folds to that image whatever
// its name, and an undotted icon-less name still folds to the 1.28.0 tile.
//
// Since 1.31.0 the code beside a stem is sized with the stem
// ([BRAND_STEM_CODE_FONT_SIZE]: its cap, or the stem's size where that
// is smaller) and laid out as the stem is, so on a phone it sits on the
// stem's baseline and is never larger than the wordmark - as the code is
// never larger than the 44px mark it sits beside on rokct.ai.
//
// Since 1.36.0 the code beside a STEM is capped at the size rokct.ai's
// ORIGINAL header rendered its code at: the superscript scale of its
// branding (BRAND_CODE_SCALE, 0.28) of the 44px mark - BRAND_CODE_FONT_SIZE,
// about 12px - not the 36px that header named inline and then overrode
// with the branding cache's style (Ray, 2026-09-10: "za in supa is big,
// look at one in rokct, original one"). The code beside a MARK or a tile
// is byte-for-byte the 1.24.0 code - rokct.ai's renders exactly as it
// did (Ray: "if i merge that one it will change country code in rokct to
// wrong one"); only the stem branch, which no mark shell reaches, takes
// the new cap. The trigger word of the groups panel may also be the
// menu's own since 1.36.0 (`megaLabel`, carried through to HeaderMenuNav).
//
// The public API is the one the two shells' own headers had, so the pages
// that already render <Header> (the auth pages, status, careers) compile
// unchanged: loginUrl / signupUrl / session, and the openLoginPopup /
// openSignupPopup handlers auth_sdk's pages pass instead of URLs. The menu
// props are new and all optional. When a caller passes NONE of menuItems /
// groups / actions the header loads the registered menu itself
// (loadHeaderMenu(), resolved against `nav` - the empty list unless the
// caller has one - so the fixed links, groups and actions render on every
// page that mounts the header while an anchor renders only where its
// section is on the page); the landing host passes the menu it resolved
// against its live nav, and props win when present.
//
// It is `sticky`, not `fixed`: it stays in the document flow, so no page
// under it needs a top padding to keep its first line visible (the hero's
// own pt-16 is unchanged from 1.13.0 either way).
//
// Since 1.38.0 the header's own "Log in" / "Sign up" pair follows the
// shell's data mode (the 1.35.0 `local` rule, which until now reached only
// the DECLARED actions through landing-page.ts): with `dataMode="local"` -
// passed by landing-content.tsx from the mode the page read through
// siteDataMode() - a visitor with no session gets no pair, on the bar and
// in the burger panel (showsHeaderAuth in landing/header-menu.ts). A
// caller that passes no mode, every page that mounted the header before,
// draws exactly what it drew.
