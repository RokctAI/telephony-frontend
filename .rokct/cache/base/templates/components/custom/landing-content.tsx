// The generic landing host's client WRAPPER (since 1.32.0 - until 1.31.0
// this was the orchestrator, and it loaded every registered section, the
// header menu and the hero copy in effects after mount, so the first HTML
// carried none of them). Now app/landing/page.tsx does that work on the
// server, through components/custom/landing/landing-page.ts, and hands
// this component the results: the header menu resolved against the live
// nav, the hero and the sections already rendered (server elements, passed
// as props), and the class names the root carries from the first HTML.
// What stays here is the one thing that needs the client: whether the
// hero's form is showing results, which hides the sections under it. That
// setter reaches the server-rendered hero through HeroResultsContext, so
// no function ever crosses the server boundary as a prop.
//
// This file still names no section of its own - base_sdk carries the host
// and the hero only; the sections of a product's landing page belong to
// its home SDK - so a shell with nothing registered renders the hero
// alone. A negative order renders before the hero (a fixed overlay such as
// a floating nav) and stays visible while the hero shows search results;
// everything else renders after the hero and hides with it. Since 1.23.0
// the network strip (components/custom/network-strip.tsx) has two surfaces
// here too - right under the hero and right before the footer anchor - and
// draws on the one the home SDK's registered placement names, or on
// neither: "none", or (since 1.27.0) "section", where a registered section
// of the home SDK's own draws the strip in its own look. Since 1.42.0 the
// floating "Back to top" button (components/custom/back-to-top.tsx) is
// mounted here too, after <main>, so every composed landing has it.
