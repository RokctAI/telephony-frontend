// The generic landing host's page: reads the session through the kernel's
// seam (never through app/(auth) directly), prefetches the platform's plans
// and hands both to the client orchestrator. base_sdk carries the host and
// the hero (copy in components/custom/landing/hero-config.ts); every
// content section comes from the home SDK that registers it in
// components/custom/landing/page-sections.ts (the hero's form from
// components/custom/landing/hero-form.ts, and what answers its input from
// components/custom/landing/hero-sections.ts), so with nothing registered
// the page is the hero alone. It also imports the platform scrollbar
// (app/styles/rokct-scroll.css, rokctai_frontend's yellow scroll thumb),
// so a composed shell has it on /landing with no host edit.
