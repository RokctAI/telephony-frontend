# Changelog

## 1.47.0

* The site frame: the shell a composed page that is not the landing sits
  in, so it reads as the same site as `/landing`. Ray, 2026-09-11 20:44Z,
  of an about page in its own bare frame: "we have no way to get here and
  its so disconnected to the rest of the site". Nothing new is registered:
  a home SDK marks the sections that ARE its frame - the theme section
  carrying `rootClass`, the footer - with `frame: true` on the `meta` it
  already exports, and keeps its header menu where it is.
  * `components/custom/landing/page-sections.ts`: `PageSectionMeta.frame`
    (optional; absent is the landing only, as before) and
    `sectionFramesSite(meta)`. A frame section still renders on the
    landing exactly as its `order` and `page` say.
  * NEW `components/custom/landing/site-frame.ts`: `arrangeSiteFrame`
    (the pure rule) and `resolveSiteFrame(ctx)` (the loader a page awaits,
    through the landing's own `loadPageSections` and `loadHeaderMenu`).
    The answer, `SiteFrameLayout`: `registered` (any frame section
    present after `renders(ctx)`), `before` (negative order) and `after`
    (the rest) in order, `rootClass` joined from the frame sections, the
    landing's `navItems`, and the header `menu` resolved against the
    LANDING's nav with every anchor on the landing route
    (`/landing#pricing`), the `local` rule dropping backend-only actions
    as the landing does. `frameSectionsOf`, `landingNavItemsOf` and
    `SITE_FRAME_ROOT_CLASS` (the landing root's own classes) beside them.
  * `components/custom/landing/header-menu.ts`: `resolveHeaderMenu` and
    `resolveHeaderMenuItems` take an optional third argument,
    `anchorHref: (id) => string` (`sameAnchorHref`, `#id`, when absent -
    every existing call is unchanged); `anchorHrefOn(route)` builds the
    one the frame passes.
  * NEW `components/custom/site-frame.tsx`: `SiteFrame({ frame?, session?,
    dataMode?, page?, children })`, a directive-free server component
    that draws the frame - the landing root's classes plus `rootClass`
    (`data-site-frame` naming the page), base's `Header` with the
    resolved menu (its links in the first HTML), the `before` sections,
    `<main>`, the `after` sections, each with the `PageSectionProps` a
    landing section gets (no plans, no nav), and `BackToTop` once. A
    page resolves the frame first and keeps its own when `registered` is
    false (corporate_sdk 1.2.0's `/about`, `/team` and `/legal` do), so a
    shell composed without a home landing still renders; a caller that
    hands no `frame` has it resolved here.
  * Nothing in base names a brand, a host or a route beyond the existing
    `LANDING_ROUTE`. A home SDK opts in with `frame: true` on its theme
    and footer sections and nothing else.
* Tests: `tests/landing-page.test.mts` executes the rule (a frame with
  nothing marked is not registered; `before` / `after` split and ordered;
  `renders` honoured; `rootClass` from frame sections only; the menu's
  anchors on the landing route, a missing anchor dropped, links kept; the
  `local` rule; `resolveSiteFrame` against the neutral registries);
  `tests/test_manifest.py` pins the installs, the field, the component's
  contract and that it is directive-free.

## 1.46.0

* The install offer runs the browser's install prompt as a real action.
  Ray, 2026-09-11 20:35:38Z: "nextjs no longer offering me to install app
  like it used to with pwa"; 20:46:43Z: "the install offer used to show
  its not showing, that bottom offer is not really an offer its
  attention, no clicking icon on browser and it try to install or it
  popup and install". Root cause, in the 1.41.0
  `components/custom/install-offer.tsx`: the `beforeinstallprompt`
  listener was attached only when NO declared download matched the
  visitor's platform (`if (platform === undefined || hasEntry) return;`),
  and only from a second effect after the platform read - so a shell
  with a matching entry never offered the install at all, and elsewhere
  an event that fired before that effect was missed while a later one
  was swallowed by `preventDefault()` with no control drawn for it. Now
  the FIRST effect on mount, before any platform read, listens for
  `beforeinstallprompt` and `appinstalled` (once, `[]`); the handler
  calls `preventDefault()` only when our control will render - a page
  running installed (`display-mode: standalone`) leaves the browser's
  own banner alone - and stashes the event, which survives until the
  visitor acts (`appinstalled` drops it). The Install control renders
  only once an event is stashed; a click calls `event.prompt()`, awaits
  `userChoice`, then clears the stash (a second click while it shows is
  ignored; a later event is stashed again). With a matching download the
  offer draws BOTH "Get the <label>" and, when an event is stashed,
  Install - the 1.41.0 link is unchanged. `BeforeInstallPromptEvent` is
  exported. The server and the first client render still draw nothing;
  every window read is in an effect. Base registers no service worker:
  the browser fires the event only for an installable page, which needs
  the host's `app/manifest.ts` to carry `icons`.
* The offered platform's icon button is hidden. Ray, 2026-09-11
  20:33:16Z, of the icon buttons: "they become double when you tell user
  to download for that platform, i think should hide the normal one when
  showing the other". NEW client component
  `components/custom/download-buttons.tsx` `DownloadButtons({ downloads,
  hideOffered? })` draws the row's buttons - the same `<a>` per entry
  `FooterChromeRow` drew (label as aria-label and title,
  `data-download-platform`, `DOWNLOAD_BUTTON_CLASS`, `DownloadMark`) -
  minus the one entry the install offer is showing. The offer publishes
  that entry's id after mount to NEW `OFFERED_DOWNLOAD`
  (`landing/install-offer.ts`; `createOfferedDownloadStore()`: a plain
  `get`/`set`/`subscribe` store, `null` until set, notifying on a change
  only) and clears it on unmount; the buttons read it through
  `React.useSyncExternalStore` with `null` as the server snapshot and
  filter with NEW `visibleDownloads(entries, offeredId)` (every entry but
  that id, in order; `null` or an unknown id keeps all). So the server
  HTML and the first client render carry EVERY icon - no window read at
  render - and the duplicate goes after mount; with no offer mounted, no
  platform recognised or an installed page nothing is hidden.
  `useOfferedDownload()` is exported for a home SDK's own row;
  `hideOffered={false}` keeps every button. `FooterChromeRow` renders
  `<DownloadButtons downloads={downloads} />` after the offer, in the
  same nav; nothing else in the row changes.
* Tests: `tests/install-offer.test.mts` (node) executes
  `visibleDownloads` and the store; `test_manifest.py` gains
  `test_install_offer_runs_the_prompt_and_hides_the_offered_icon` (the
  early attach, the guarded `preventDefault`, `prompt()` then
  `userChoice`, the publish, the row's snapshot), re-pins the 1.41.0
  offer and row needles (three effects now; the buttons in their file)
  and raises the node pass floor. Manifest installs the new file.
  `docs/downloads-and-install.md` describes both.
* The hero's logo tile can be declared away. `HeroConfig.logo?: "tile" |
  "none"` (`landing/hero-config.ts`, beside `brand`): `"tile"` - the
  default, `HERO_CONFIG.logo`, and what every shell drew - draws the
  host's `BrandLogo` (56px, with its badge) beside the wordmark slot;
  `"none"` skips that render in `hero-view.tsx`
  (`{hero.logo !== "none" && <BrandLogo width={56} height={56} showBadge={true} />}`),
  for a shell whose `BrandLogo` is the full wordmark while the hero
  already draws the stem (`brand: "stem"` or `"stem-tld"`) - the same
  declaration the header's brand takes (`logo: "none"`). A home SDK's
  hero copy declares it; nothing changes until one does.
  `test_manifest.py` gains `test_hero_logo_tile_can_be_declared_none`.
* Home SDKs: nothing to declare for the install offer; a shell that
  mounts the offer in a header slot and its own icon row imports
  `DownloadButtons` (or `useOfferedDownload`) for the same hiding. A
  home SDK whose host `BrandLogo` is the wordmark declares
  `logo: "none"` in its hero copy.

## 1.45.0

* The public terms list falls back to the shell's bundled `data/legal`
  pages when the backend publishes nothing. `app/actions/base/legal.ts`
  `listPublicTerms()` still asks the backend first, as a guest, for
  every enabled "Terms and Conditions" document and returns its rows
  unchanged whenever it answers any; when the answer is nothing - no
  base URL (a shell with no backend), a refused guest read, a failed
  call, or a backend that has published no document yet - and the shell
  bundles the 1.35.0 `legal` kind (`hasSiteData("legal")`: a `local` or
  `hybrid` data mode with `data/legal/<slug>.md` files present, never
  backend mode), the answer is those pages, each as the same
  `{name: slug, title, disabled: false}` a gateway row becomes, in slug
  order, read through the generated `lib/site-data/generated.ts` and
  never the disk at request time. The two lists are never merged, the
  guest soft-fail is kept (a failing bundle read logs and answers `[]`),
  and a shell with no legal folder, or in backend mode, answers exactly
  what it did. A footer's Legal row (`legalFooterLinks`) and
  corporate_sdk's `/legal` index, which already read `listPublicTerms()`,
  list the shell's own documents with no code change - a shell whose
  backend has no documents carries its own markdown instead. Shells need
  the `prebuild` generate step (`docs/site-data.md`) and a data mode that
  bundles legal for the fallback to have anything to answer.
  `tests/legal-fallback.test.mts` executes the action against a
  `generated.ts` the real generator writes from the acme fixture and
  against the neutral module.

## 1.42.0

* The landing has a floating "Back to top" button. Ray, 2026-09-11
  12:32Z: "whats missing is floating push to home, that button you press
  and it get you to top i just forgot what it says". NEW client component
  `components/custom/back-to-top.tsx` `BackToTop({ threshold?, label?,
  className? })`: hidden at the top of the page, shown once the visitor
  has scrolled past `threshold` pixels (one viewport height by default,
  read on every check), fixed at the bottom right (`bottom-4 right-4`,
  `md:bottom-6 md:right-6`, the safe-area inset as margin) at `z-30` -
  under the sticky header (`z-50`) and its mobile panel (`z-40`), so an
  open menu covers it, and clear of the left edge and the vertical
  middle a home SDK's floating nav uses; the install offer is inline in
  the footer, never fixed, so the two never meet. A click calls
  `window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior })` - `"smooth"`, or `"auto"` (the
  instant jump) when `(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` matches - and
  blurs the button. The scroll and resize listeners are `passive: true`
  and folded into one `requestAnimationFrame` per frame; every window
  read is in the effect or the click, never at render, so the server and
  the first client render agree on hidden. The button stays in the tree
  and fades (`motion-safe:transition-opacity`); while hidden it carries
  `tabIndex={-1}`, `aria-hidden` and `pointer-events-none`, so it is
  never in the tab order unseen. `aria-label` and `title` are
  `BACK_TO_TOP_LABEL` ("Back to top"; `label` overrides). Lucide's
  `ArrowUp`, the icon set the shells already import; theme tokens only
  (`bg-background`, `border-border`, `text-primary`, `hover:bg-muted`,
  `ring-ring`). NEW `landing/back-to-top.ts` is the pure half:
  `BACK_TO_TOP_LABEL`, `REDUCED_MOTION_MEDIA_QUERY`,
  `resolveThreshold(threshold, viewportHeight)`,
  `isPastThreshold(scrollY, threshold)` (strictly past, so the top is
  always hidden), `scrollBehaviour(reducedMotion)`.
  `components/custom/landing-content.tsx` mounts `<BackToTop />` once,
  after `<main>`, so a base-only host and a home SDK's composed landing
  (its `/` sends an anonymous visitor to `/landing`) both have it with
  no host edit; a host that wants it on every page mounts it in its own
  root layout. `docs/downloads-and-install.md` describes it.
* The header's suffix no longer clips its last glyph. Ray, 2026-09-11
  13:57Z: the final "l" of the site name's suffix was "a bit cut". The
  suffix span (`components/custom/header.tsx` `BrandStemWordmark`) clips
  its own overflow so the slot can slide closed over it, and its box is
  the text's advance width - so once a home SDK italicises the wordmark
  through the `data-brand-wordmark="stem"` hook, the last glyph's
  italic overhang (a 900 italic lowercase "l" leans about 0.09em past
  its advance) was sheared off at the box's right edge. The span now
  carries `pr-[0.12em] -mr-[0.12em]`: the padding keeps the overhang
  inside the clipped box, the negative margin hands that width back to
  the grid, so the track, the stem's width and the country code beside
  it measure exactly what they did, open and folded. No font, size or
  colour changes; an upright face draws as before. The hero's suffix
  never clipped and is untouched.
* Tests: NEW `tests/back-to-top.test.mts` (node) executes the rules;
  `test_manifest.py` gains
  `test_back_to_top_is_a_client_component_mounted_in_the_landing_shell`,
  `test_back_to_top_rules_under_node`,
  `test_back_to_top_type_checks_under_tsc` and
  `test_brand_suffix_has_room_for_its_italic_overhang`. Manifest
  installs the two new files.

## 1.41.0

* The site name's suffix is in the primary colour. Ray, 2026-09-11
  07:34:03Z: "also site name the .school get primary color in nextjs".
  The header's stem wordmark (`components/custom/header.tsx`
  `BrandStemWordmark`) draws the dot and what follows the stem in
  `text-primary` - the theme token, no brand colour named - with its own
  `data-brand-wordmark="tld"` hook on that span
  (`<span data-brand-wordmark="tld" className="min-w-0 overflow-hidden text-primary">`);
  the stem span, the country-code span, the wordmark's class list and
  the slide are untouched. The hero has the matching mode:
  `HeroConfig.brand` accepts `"stem-tld"` (`landing/hero-config.ts`),
  `resolveHeroWordmark` (`landing/landing-page.ts`) answers
  `{ text, name, suffix }` for it - `HeroWordmark.suffix?` is the trimmed
  name after the stem - and `HeroWordmarkSlot` (`hero-view.tsx`) draws the
  suffix after the stem inside the same span, in primary with the same
  hook, sized over the stem and the suffix together; `"stem"` and `"name"`
  draw exactly what they drew. `docs/downloads-and-install.md` describes
  both.
* The footer's downloads are icon buttons. Ray, 2026-09-11 07:34:37Z:
  "footer has  download links let them be platform icons buttons". NEW
  `FooterChromeConfig.downloads?: DownloadEntry[]`
  (`landing/footer-chrome-config.ts`): `DownloadPlatform` is the closed
  set `ios | android | huawei | macos | windows | linux | web`, and
  `DownloadEntry` is `{ id, platform, label, href, external?, title?,
  mark?: BrandMarkId }`. `FooterChromeRow` (`components/custom/footer-chrome.tsx`)
  draws them as `<nav aria-label="Downloads">` beside the link groups,
  above the copyright line, one `<a>` per entry - the label as
  aria-label and title, external ones `target="_blank"
  rel="noreferrer"`, `h-10 w-10 rounded-full border border-border
  bg-transparent hover:bg-muted flex items-center justify-center` - with
  the named mark from `BRAND_MARKS` through `next/image` and
  `markImageClass`, else a neutral glyph from NEW
  `landing/platform-glyphs.tsx` (`PlatformGlyph`: a phone, a laptop, a
  terminal, a globe in `currentColor`; `DownloadMark`; the button class
  `DOWNLOAD_BUTTON_CLASS`) - never a third-party mark drawn by hand. NEW
  `landing/download-platform.ts` is the pure half: `DOWNLOAD_PLATFORMS`,
  `isDownloadPlatform`, `isDownloadHref` (https with a host, or a route
  with one leading slash), `isDownloadEntry`, `normaliseDownloads`,
  `downloadTitle`. `FooterChromeLabels.downloads` ("Downloads") names the
  nav. Nothing declared draws nothing; base declares no entry.
* The install offer checks the platform. Ray, 2026-09-11 07:37:17Z:
  "this nextjs has install, it does show on mobile though i havent seen
  it in desktop i think it installs as pwa but i think it should check
  the platform and offer app of that platform". NEW client component
  `components/custom/install-offer.tsx` `InstallOffer({ downloads,
  labels?, platform?, className? })`: nothing on the server and the first
  client render; after mount it hides when
  `matchMedia("(display-mode: standalone)")` matches, reads the platform
  (NEW `landing/install-offer.ts` `detectPlatform()`:
  `navigator.userAgentData.platform`, then the user-agent string -
  iPhone/iPad, HarmonyOS/HUAWEI, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux/X11 - and
  `detectPlatformFrom(hints)` for tests), picks the entry
  (`pickDownload(entries, platform)`: its own platform first, android and
  huawei standing in for each other, the desktops and iOS their own
  only, `DOWNLOAD_FALLBACKS`) and draws one icon button with "Get the
  <label>" linking there; with none it listens for `beforeinstallprompt`,
  keeps the event and draws "Install", which calls `prompt()`; with
  neither it draws nothing. `INSTALL_OFFER_LABELS` (`get`, `install`) and
  `installOfferText` hold the words; `platform` forces one for a preview.
  `FooterChromeRow` mounts it FIRST in the Downloads nav (`installOffer`
  prop, default true); a home SDK that wants it in a header slot imports
  `@/components/custom/install-offer` itself - no header change in base.
* Tests: NEW `tests/download-platform.test.mts` and
  `tests/install-offer.test.mts` (node) execute the rules;
  `landing-page.test.mts` covers `"stem-tld"`; `header-brand.test.mts`
  reads the suffix span's new markup; `test_manifest.py` gains
  `test_brand_suffix_is_in_the_primary_colour`,
  `test_footer_downloads_seam_shape`,
  `test_install_offer_is_a_client_component_that_checks_the_platform` and
  `test_download_and_install_rules_under_node`, and reads the suffix
  span's new markup in the 1.29.0 test. Manifest installs the four new
  files.
* Home SDKs: lms_sdk 1.31.0 declares its entries (the marks by key, its
  own hrefs) on its footer config; supacharge re-pins after.

## 1.40.0

* The network strip's sites come from the home SDK that owns them, or
  from the shell's own data, never from base (Ray, 2026-09-11: a shell
  with no declaration shows no "Trusted by" strip - a shell outside the
  network must not list products it has nothing to do with; site names
  are brand content and logos are hostnames, neither of which base may
  hard-code). NEW `NetworkStripConfig.sites?: NetworkSite[]` on
  `components/custom/landing/network-strip.ts` is where a home SDK
  declares the network beside its heading, order, hidden keys and
  placement; `resolveNetworkStrip(config, selfHost, sites)` draws
  `config.sites` when the config declares them and its `sites` argument
  otherwise. `NETWORK_SITES` in `network-sites.ts` is now an EMPTY
  readonly list - the default the rules fall back to, so nothing is drawn
  with nothing declared - and the hidden place-holder entries went with
  the list to the home SDK. The `NetworkSite` shape, `networkSiteHost`,
  `hasTrackingParameters`, self-exclusion by host and the once-per-page
  rule are unchanged; `networkStripRendersAt` already answered false with
  no site, so a config that says only WHERE the strip goes draws nothing
  until its sites arrive. A shell whose home SDK registers no `sites` and
  runs in local or hybrid data mode may commit `data/network.json`: NEW
  site-data kind `network` (`lib/site-data/kinds.ts` `SiteNetwork`
  `{ heading?, sites: SiteNetworkSite[] }`, `SITE_DATA_KINDS`,
  `SITE_DATA_FILES`; `validate.mjs` `validateNetwork` holds every `url`
  to an https origin with no path, query string or fragment - or `null`
  with `shown: false` - and every logo to a path or URL with no
  parameters), read by the NEW `"use server"` action
  `app/actions/base/network-sites.ts` `getNetworkSites()` (`{ sites: [] }`
  in backend mode or with no file, the bundled file otherwise). NEW
  `withOwnNetworkSites(config, own)` on `network-strip.ts` lays the data
  under the config - registered sites win, else the shell's own data (and
  its heading when the config names none), else none - and
  `components/custom/network-strip.tsx`'s `loadResolvedNetworkStrip`
  answers that merge; the module-level render resolves the registered
  config with the page (`loadNetworkStripInputs`) and reads the data
  AFTER MOUNT (`loadOwnNetworkSites`, `useOwnNetworkSites`), because a
  server function cannot be called while a client component renders on
  the server, so the server markup and the first client render agree. A
  home SDK that draws the strip itself (a "section" placement) keeps
  calling `loadResolvedNetworkStrip` and, with its own `sites` declared,
  never waits on the action. `docs/site-data.md` gains the kind.
* Tests: `network-strip.test.mts` no longer pins any brand - its list is
  an inline fixture handed to the rules as the `sites` argument - and
  asserts `NETWORK_SITES` is empty, a declared `sites` wins over the
  argument, `withOwnNetworkSites` in every combination, and zero sites
  rendering on no surface; `site-data.test.mts` validates
  `data/network.json` (the acme fixture gains one) and bundles it;
  `test_manifest.py` replaces `test_network_sites_list_shape` with
  `test_network_sites_list_is_empty` and
  `test_network_sites_come_from_the_home_sdk_or_data` (the action is
  installed, names no host and no brand; the component stages the data
  read after mount), and its first-party host allowlist drops the product
  origins - no base default names one now.
* Home SDKs: agent_sdk declares rokct.ai's five entries (three sites, two
  hidden place-holders) on its registration in the same release train;
  lms_sdk's registration (`footer: false`, landing `none`) and every shell
  with no registration draw no strip, as ruled.
* A registered section whose module loads with NO default export is
  skipped, not rendered: `loadPageSection` in
  `components/custom/landing/landing-page.ts` now checks
  `typeof mod.default === "function"` before it builds the section, logs
  one `console.error` naming the section id ("its module has no default
  export; section skipped", with `SECTION_ENTRY_CONTRACT`) and answers
  null, the way a module that fails to load already did - so the rest of
  the page renders instead of React throwing "Element type is invalid" at
  render time and the route answering 500. A module with a default export
  is loaded exactly as before, its `meta` read or defaulted as before.
  `landing-page.test.mts` gains the case: a module with meta but no
  default export (and one whose default is not a function) is skipped
  with the error logged and no meta warning, and a proper module beside
  it still renders with its own meta.
* A 2xx status probe whose body is EMPTY is not an answer:
  `getPlatformStatus` (`app/actions/base/status.ts`) now asks NEW
  `isProbeAnswer(answer)` on `components/custom/landing/footer-chrome-config.ts`
  (a plain object with at least one field, the gateway's `message`
  envelope looked through) after `attempted = true` and before it reads
  the answer, and `continue`s when the resolved body is null, undefined,
  a scalar, an array, `{}` or `{"message": null}` - a proxy or a
  placeholder page in front of a backend that is not there answers 200
  with nothing, and that read as `operational`. The three empty shapes
  `platformCall` produces all read as `offline`: a body that parses to
  JSON null (`platformCall` answers null and throws nothing), a genuinely
  empty body (`res.json()` rejects, so it throws a `network_error`) and a
  body of `{"message": null}` (`data.message || data` hands back the
  envelope itself, a truthy object). It now reads as `offline` once every
  probe is tried (the doc comment that said "an answer at all is the
  signal" now says an answer with something in it is). The three states
  keep their meaning: `unconfigured` - the state the footer hides the
  indicator on - is reached from `ROKCT_STATUS_SOURCE=off` / `none`, or
  from no probe having an origin to ask, and never from a failed or an
  empty probe, which are `offline`; a real answer is `operational` or
  `maintenance` with its version, as before. Tests: NEW `status.test.mts`
  executes the action against a stub gateway (one test per empty shape:
  a JSON-null body, a body that fails to parse, `{"message": null}` -
  plus `undefined`, `{}`, a scalar and an array - each offline and never
  operational or unconfigured; `{status:"ok"}` is
  operational; the envelope's maintenance and version read as before; an
  empty tenant answer falls through to an opted-in control probe; `off` /
  `none` are unconfigured with no probe run; a failed probe is offline,
  not unconfigured), staged by `test_manifest.py`'s NEW
  `test_status_action_behaviour_under_node` and held in shape by
  `test_status_action_treats_an_empty_answer_as_none`;
  `status-probes.test.mts` covers `isProbeAnswer` itself.
* The admin system-info actions ask a cmd that EXISTS for the version.
  `app/actions/base/admin/settings.ts` and `system.ts` `getSystemInfo`
  called `paasCall("api.get_version")`, a cmd registered nowhere -
  not among the tenant cmds in `base/frappe/manifest.json`, not in the
  platform's hooks, not in any cached SDK manifest - so the version was
  always null. Both now call `paasCall(PLATFORM_VERSION_CMD)` - NEW on
  `components/custom/landing/footer-chrome-config.ts`,
  `"api.system.api_status"`, the one registered tenant cmd that carries
  `version` (`{data: {status, version, user}}`; the same cmd the footer's
  tenant probe asks) - and read it with NEW `readPlatformVersion(answer)`
  beside it (the envelope, the gateway's `message` wrapper around it, or
  a bare `version`; a string, else null). The callers' return shape is
  unchanged (`{ ...info, version }`); `status.ts` reads its version
  through the same reader. Tests: `status-probes.test.mts` asserts the
  cmd name and the reader's string-or-null rule; `test_manifest.py`'s NEW
  `test_admin_system_info_asks_a_registered_version_cmd` holds both call
  sites to the constant, checks the frappe manifest registers the cmd and
  not the phantom, and that no template or kernel file asks
  `api.get_version`.
* The header's stem wordmark is set in the same face as the hero's (Ray,
  2026-09-11: on supacharge.school the "Supacharge" wordmark is right in
  the hero and the footer but wrong in the header). The header's
  `BrandStemWordmark` (`components/custom/header.tsx`) and the hero's
  `HeroWordmarkSlot` (`components/custom/hero-view.tsx`) now carry the
  SAME font utilities - `font-bold tracking-tighter leading-none`, no
  family of their own - so both inherit the face the shell's root
  declares (the hero span's `font-sans`, which forced Tailwind's default
  stack over whatever the shell set, is gone; the header never had one),
  and both carry the one hook `data-brand-wordmark="stem"`, so a home
  SDK that gives its wordmark a face of its own styles the header and
  the hero with ONE rule instead of reaching the hero through a deep
  selector and leaving the header in the body font. The code span
  beside the stem keeps `font-medium` at its `calc(44px * 0.28)` cap;
  the stem's label (`brandStemLabel`) and sizes are unchanged. NEW
  `test_header_stem_wordmark_shares_the_hero_wordmark_font` holds the
  two class lists equal.
* The admin settings and content actions send their `frappe.client.*`
  calls through the gateway instead of nowhere. `app/actions/base/admin/settings.ts`
  (21 sites: payment gateways, permission settings, Flutter app and build
  settings, terms, privacy policies) and `admin/content.ts` (4 sites:
  FAQs) still called `frappe.call({ method, args })` on the client from
  `getPaaSClient()`; frappe-js-sdk's `call()` takes no object argument,
  so those calls sent nothing and the admin surfaces were silently
  empty. Every site is now `paasCall(cmd, args)` - the cmd string
  verbatim, the same args, the `message` envelope unwrapped by the
  gateway as the already-migrated sites in the same files have it - and
  the `getPaaSClient` import is gone from both. NEW
  `test_admin_actions_call_the_gateway_not_the_sdk_client` in
  `test_manifest.py` walks every action file and fails on any `.call({`,
  `frappe.call(` or `as any).call(` left, on a `getPaaSClient` import,
  or on a dotted `/api/method/` URL, and pins the 25 sites per cmd.

## 1.39.0

* The folded brand stem is capitalised where base shows ONLY the stem
  (Ray, 2026-09-11 04:23Z: the brand string stays the domain, lower
  case - "supacharge.school" - and the stem without ".school" is
  capitalised: "supacharge" shows as "Supacharge"). NEW
  `brandStemLabel(name)` beside `brandStemOf` in
  `components/custom/landing/header-menu.ts` is the one rule: the
  1.29.0 stem with its first character upper-cased, `null` for a name
  with no stem exactly as `brandStemOf` answers, so an undotted name
  ("Rokct") is never touched and a stem that already starts upper-case
  ("Juvo") is itself. The header's stem wordmark (`header.tsx`,
  `BrandStemWordmark`) shows the label in the stem span, still cuts the
  suffix from the name at the stem's length so ".school" slides away
  as it did, and now carries `title={name.trim()}` - the full name as
  declared. The hero's stem wordmark (`landing-page.ts`,
  `resolveHeroWordmark`) answers `{ text: brandStemLabel(name) ?? name,
  name }`, so `brand: "stem"` draws "Supacharge" with the full domain on
  the element's aria-label and title as before; the whole-name case
  ("stem" on an undotted name) is unchanged. Nothing else changes case:
  the site metadata, the network strip, the footer and every brand
  string source stay what the shell declared. The fold rule, the
  1.36.0 code cap (`calc(44px * 0.28)`) and the code's placement beside
  the stem are untouched; no brand string is named in base.
* Tests: `header-brand.test.mts` gains the `brandStemLabel` cases
  (lower-case, already-capitalised and undotted names, the header
  markup) and `landing-page.test.mts` reads "Acme" / "Supacharge" from
  `resolveHeroWordmark` with the lower-case name beside it;
  `test_manifest.py` gains `test_folded_stem_is_capitalised` (one
  `toUpperCase` in base, in `brandStemLabel`; the header and the hero
  show the label and title the full name).
* Release order: 1.38.0 (RokctAI/core #220, the page slot and the
  header's local-mode switch) merged first; this release sits above it
  on main and touches none of its files' rules.

## 1.38.0

* A registered section may name the PAGE it belongs to, so a home SDK's
  card reaches a company page through the one registry it already knows
  (Ray, 2026-09-10: corporate_sdk owns `/about` and `/team` as renderers;
  their content comes from the shell's `data/` folder - base 1.35.0's
  reader - or is empty, and Supacharge's about page reuses lms's founder
  card). `PageSectionMeta.page?: "landing" | "about" | "team"`
  (`components/custom/landing/page-sections.ts`; `PageSlot`, `PAGE_SLOTS`,
  `DEFAULT_PAGE_SLOT`, `sectionPageOf(meta)`): absent is `"landing"`, and
  every section registered before this field renders exactly where it
  did. `arrangeLandingPage` keeps only landing sections - a section that
  names another page is neither drawn nor a floating-nav stop on the
  landing - and NEW `pageSectionsFor(page, ctx?, entries?)` in
  `landing-page.ts` is what a company page's renderer awaits: the same
  loader (a failing module skipped and logged, an unreadable meta
  rendered with defaults), the same `meta.renders(ctx)` and `meta.order`
  rules (`presentSectionsFor`, the rule both share), filtered to that
  page; `ctx` defaults to no plans and no session, and nothing registered
  answers `[]`. No brand, route or host is named by either module.
* The header's own "Log in" / "Sign up" pair follows the shell's data
  mode - the TODO 1.35.0 left on `dropBackendOnlyActions`, now that the
  header files are free. `app/landing/page.tsx` hands the mode it read
  through `siteDataMode()` to `landing-content.tsx` (`dataMode?`), which
  passes it to `header.tsx` (`HeaderProps.dataMode?: SiteDataMode`); for
  a visitor with no session the header draws no pair, on the bar and in
  the burger panel, when `showsHeaderAuth(dataMode)` (NEW in
  `landing/header-menu.ts`, pure: false for `"local"` only) says so, and
  the burger hides with nothing left to open. A page that mounts the
  header without the prop - every caller before this release - draws the
  pair as it did; the "use client" files import only the `SiteDataMode`
  type from `lib/site-data/kinds`, never the server-only reader.
* `docs/site-data.md`: the legal kind's title rule now reads "the first
  level-1 heading" - the code span that held a hash and a trailing space
  failed markdownlint MD038 (no-space-in-code) in every host that vendors
  the docs; the doc also gains the company-pages section and the switched
  header paragraph.
* Tests: `tests/landing-page.test.mts` (+6: the slots, a landing
  arrangement identical with and without the field, a company-page
  section kept off the landing, the filter / renders / stable order rule,
  `pageSectionsFor` over given entries and over the live registry),
  `tests/header-brand.test.mts` (+2: `showsHeaderAuth` and the header
  reading it on both surfaces), `test_manifest.py` (the page-slot
  contract, the header switch, the local-mode test updated for the
  wrapper's fourth `dataMode`, the header-menu stage stubbing the type).

## 1.37.0

* The footer chrome has a links seam, and base reads the shell's legal
  documents for it. Ray, 2026-09-10: "supa has no terms pages or about
  page"; asked where the pages belong: "legal pages are not in corporate
  sdk?" and "you should look at the dart side if they are not there
  yet". On the Dart side `corporate_sdk` owns the policy / terms pages
  and every auth composition includes it, so the Next.js layout mirrors
  that split: the pages at `/legal` and `/legal/<name>` are
  `corporate_sdk`'s (RokctAI/corporate `corporate/corporate/nextjs`,
  floor base_sdk >= 1.37.0); base carries the links and the read only.
  * `FooterChromeConfig.links?: FooterLinkGroup[]`
    (`components/custom/landing/footer-chrome-config.ts`): `{id, label,
    items: {id, label, href, external?}[]}`. `FooterChromeRow`
    (`components/custom/footer-chrome.tsx`) draws the groups as one
    compact labelled row between the network strip and the copyright
    line, internal links through `next/link`, external ones with
    `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, and NOTHING when `links` is absent or
    every group is empty - rokct.ai and supacharge render exactly what
    they rendered until their home SDK opts in.
  * NEW `app/actions/base/legal.ts`: `listPublicTerms()` reads every
    enabled "Terms and Conditions" document (the doctype the admin editor
    at `app/admin/settings/terms` writes) as `{name, title, disabled}`
    through the platform gateway as a guest, and soft-fails to `[]` with
    no backend, a refused guest read or a failed call - the shape
    `getLandingPlans` takes, so a footer lists nothing rather than the
    page failing.
  * NEW `components/custom/landing/legal-links.ts`, the pure half:
    `PublicTerm`, `normalisePublicTerms(rows)` (drops disabled and
    malformed rows, `null` is `[]`), `legalDocHref(name)` and
    `legalFooterLinks(terms, label?)`, which maps the documents to
    `/legal/<name>` links under one "Legal" group - the only word base
    owns here; titles come from the documents, never from code - or to no
    group when nothing is published.
* Tests: `tests/legal-links.test.mts` (node) executes the rule;
  `test_manifest.py` holds the seam's shape, the installs and that the
  footer draws no row without groups.
* The footer status probes the tenant only by default. Ray, 2026-09-09:
  every shell reads its footer status from its own tenant backend, never
  from control. `resolvePlatformStatusProbes()` with `ROKCT_STATUS_SOURCE`
  unset now runs `DEFAULT_PLATFORM_STATUS_SOURCES` (`["tenant"]`); the
  control probe is opt-in (`ROKCT_STATUS_SOURCE=control`, or
  `tenant,control` to keep it as a fallback). Variable names unchanged;
  `tests/status-probes.test.mts` holds the default and the opt-in.
## 1.36.0

* A header-menu group may lay its items out in ONE ROW, and the menu
  may name the trigger's word (Ray, 2026-09-10, on supacharge: "header
  app links first. if possible put mobile apps in one row since supa
  dont have much menu"). `HeaderMenuGroup.layout?: "column" | "row"`
  (default `"column"`, everything before this release): a `"row"`
  group's items sit side by side in the desktop panel - cards keep
  their icon, label and blurb and shrink to share the width (`min-w-0
  flex-1` cells, `md:flex-row`, `data-layout` on the list). A row group
  that LEADS the panel widens the lead column from 300px to 58% of the
  panel (about 650px at `max-w-6xl`, three cards of about 210px) and
  the headed columns share the rest; alone in the panel it takes the
  whole width; a row group AFTER the lead spans the headed grid
  (`col-span-full`). The burger's stacked list ignores the layout.
  `HeaderMenu.megaLabel?: string` is the trigger's word: without it the
  trigger reads the first group's label as it has since 1.18.0; with it
  a shell may put any group first while the bar still reads what it
  declares. `resolveHeaderMenu()` carries both (`layout` on every
  resolved group, `megaLabel` trimmed or null on the menu),
  `resolveHeaderMenuGroupLayout()` and `megaTriggerLabel()` are the pure
  rules, `HeaderProps.megaLabel` / `HeaderMenuNavProps.megaLabel` carry
  it to the trigger, and the landing host passes it with the groups.
* The country code beside a STEM wordmark is capped at the size
  rokct.ai's ORIGINAL header rendered its code at (Ray, 2026-09-10: "za
  in supa is big, look at one in rokct, original one"). That header
  named 36px inline and then spread the branding cache's style over the
  span, and the cache's style is a 0.28em superscript, so 36px was only
  the fallback for a cache with no style - never what rokct.ai showed.
  `BRAND_CODE_SCALE` (0.28) of `BRAND_MARK_SIZE_PX` (44) is
  `BRAND_CODE_FONT_SIZE`, `calc(44px * 0.28)`, about 12px, and
  `BRAND_STEM_CODE_FONT_SIZE` is now `min(` that `, BRAND_STEM_FONT_SIZE)`
  - the 1.31.0 follow-the-stem rule with the new cap, so on a phone the
  code is still never larger than the stem. For a 17-character name:
  1280 was 36px, now 12.32px; 768 was 28.78px, now 12.32px; 390 was
  21.37px, now 12.32px. The code beside a MARK or a letter tile is
  byte-for-byte the 1.24.0 code (`text-[36px]`, the -2px top), so
  rokct.ai's country code renders exactly as it did (Ray: "if i merge
  that one it will change country code in rokct to wrong one" - it does
  not), and a declaration's own style is still merged over the header's.
* The hero's STEM wordmark is no longer clipped by its own slot (Ray,
  2026-09-10, on supacharge: "supa name in hero cut off on g and e").
  `hero-view.tsx` draws the stem at `leading-none` inside the slot that
  hides its overflow (that is how the slot closes when the form takes
  over), and a 1em line box is shorter than a face's glyphs: the
  descenders of "g" and "p" reached below it (Inter's by about 0.11em,
  Montserrat's by 0.07em) and were cut flat, and an italic face's last
  glyph overhangs its advance width and lost its right edge. The span
  now carries `HERO_STEM_PADDING_CLASS`, `py-[0.15em] px-[0.05em]` -
  padding rather than line height because a home SDK restyles the span
  from outside (face, size, `line-height: 1 !important`) and would undo
  a leading change; and symmetric so the glyphs do not move (the row is
  a fixed 72px with the slot centred in it, so equal padding above and
  below keeps the baseline where it was and only the slot's box grows).
  Font size, tracking and everything around the slot are unchanged;
  measured on supacharge at 1280/768/390: 5px, 5px and 3.7px of the
  descenders and 1.2-1.6px of the last glyph were clipped before, 0px
  after.
* Tests: `header-brand.test.mts` gains the layout and trigger-word
  cases (the stage now carries `header-menu.tsx`) and the stem-code
  cases read the new cap; `test_manifest.py` gains
  `test_header_code_beside_a_mark_is_untouched_and_the_stem_cap_is_the_original`,
  `test_header_menu_group_row_layout_and_trigger_word` and
  `test_hero_stem_wordmark_has_room_for_its_descenders`.

## 1.35.0

* The shell's host-owned `data/` folder, and an explicit data mode. Ray,
  2026-09-10: "do you think we need a data folder for non backend shells?
  so if the folder exist sdks read it?", "but dont the shell need to
  anounce im local so it look for data/ first?", "what we cant give sdk we
  can give data/". A shell with no backend (South River), or one that
  keeps some content with the site, commits a `data/` folder and announces
  how it is read with ONE top-level key in its own composer.json,
  `"data": "local" | "backend" | "hybrid"`. Absent is `backend`: today's
  behaviour, byte for byte - rokct.ai and Supacharge change nothing. The
  declaration is explicit rather than "the folder exists" so a half-static
  shell can never silently call a backend it does not have, and so base
  has one signal for hiding backend-only surface.
  * Kinds and files: `theme` (`data/theme.json`: `primary`, optional
    `secondary`, `accent`, hex strings), `team` (`data/team.json`:
    `members[]` of `name`, `role`, optional `photo`, `links[]`),
    `stockists` (`data/stockists.json`: `items[]` of `name`, `address`,
    `town`, optional `lat`/`lng` together, `mapsUrl`), `products`
    (`data/products.json`: `items[]` of `name`, optional `description`,
    `sizes[]`, `image`, `status` "active" | "coming"), `about`
    (`data/about.md`, the markdown verbatim) and `legal`
    (`data/legal/<slug>.md`, a map of slug to `{ title, markdown }`; the
    title from a `title:` front-matter line, else the first level-1
    heading, which is then removed from the body). Types in
    `lib/site-data/kinds.ts`; the checks, hand-written and dependency-free,
    in `lib/site-data/validate.mjs`. The brand name is never in data/.
  * Bundled at BUILD time, never read at request time. A new script,
    `lib/site-data/generate.mjs`, run from the shell root before
    `next build` (the shell's own package.json `"prebuild": "node
    lib/site-data/generate.mjs"`, plus `predev`; npm runs it on its own
    before `build`, so Vercel's `bash scripts/compose.sh && npm run build`
    composes, generates, builds), reads composer.json's `"data"`, reads
    and validates every known file under data/ and writes
    `lib/site-data/generated.ts` - the typed module the reader imports.
    base installs the neutral `generated.ts` (backend, no files), so a
    shell that never runs the script builds exactly as before. A bad file
    fails the build naming the file and the field
    ("data/team.json: members[1].role must be a non-empty string"), so
    does an unknown mode, an unknown file in data/ (a typo such as
    teams.json) and, in local mode, a kind an installed SDK's manifest
    requires (`"site_data": { "requires": ["about"] }`) with no file.
  * The reader, `lib/site-data/read-site-data.ts` (server-only), for any
    composed SDK's server code: `readSiteData(kind)` answers the kind's
    file, typed by kind; `hasSiteData(kind)` whether it would, never
    throwing; `siteDataMode()` the declared mode. The rule
    (`resolveSiteData` in kinds.ts): backend answers undefined for
    everything; hybrid the file when it was bundled, else undefined and
    the caller falls back to its backend; local the file, or an Error
    naming the missing file - a local shell has nothing to fall back to.
    Import paths: `@/lib/site-data/read-site-data` for the functions,
    `@/lib/site-data/kinds` for the types (importable from client code).
    corporate_sdk 1.1.0 is the first consumer: its legal, about and team
    renderers read their content here.
  * Theme: with a `data/theme.json` the shell's colours reach every
    route. `components/custom/site-theme.tsx` (server) renders one
    `<style>` with a `:root` block from `lib/site-data/site-theme.ts`:
    `--primary`, `--secondary`, `--accent` as the HSL triplets the
    shells' shadcn tokens expect, a `-foreground` for each picked for
    contrast, `--ring` following primary, and the raw hex as
    `--site-primary` / `--site-secondary` / `--site-accent`. It is
    rendered by `components/custom/theme-provider.tsx`, the seam every
    host layout already wraps its page in - which is now a directive-free
    SERVER entry over the new `theme-provider.client.tsx` (next-themes,
    the 1.22.0 dark default and class attribute, unchanged), the same
    split as a landing section's entry and its `<name>.client.tsx`. Order:
    the host's globals.css first, this block after it in `<body>` (wins
    over the `:root` and `.dark` token blocks, same specificity, later),
    and a home SDK's own theme set later in the document or on a more
    specific selector (lms_sdk's `.sc-landing { ... }`) still wins over
    it. No theme file, or backend mode: nothing is rendered and the markup
    of every shell composed today is unchanged.
  * Local mode switches off backend-only surface base owns: the landing
    prefetches no plans (every section already handles the empty list)
    and `arrangeLandingPage` drops the DECLARED header actions (a home
    SDK's `HeaderMenu.actions`) whose href is the sign-in or sign-up
    route (`dropBackendOnlyActions`, applied to the resolved menu, so
    header.tsx and header-menu.ts are untouched). `PageSectionContext`
    and `PageSectionProps` carry `dataMode` so a home SDK's `meta.renders`
    keeps pricing or a sign-in strip off a local shell. The footer status
    pill already hides itself with no base URL (state "unconfigured"); the
    1.37.0 status-probe default keeps its own files. NOT yet switched, on
    purpose: the header's own "Log in" / "Sign up" pair - header.tsx
    draws it for a visitor with no session from the `loginUrl` /
    `signupUrl` props landing-content.tsx passes, and both files belong
    to the 1.36.0 header branch. `siteDataMode()` is the switch; the TODO
    sits on `dropBackendOnlyActions` for the 1.36.0 merge (header.tsx
    skips the pair when the mode is "local").
* Tests: `tests/site-data.test.mts` (validators for every kind, the
  legal title rule, the mode rule in all three modes with a missing and
  a present file, hex to HSL and contrast, the generator end to end
  against `tests/fixtures/site-data/` - valid acme.school-style fixtures,
  a bad field, an unknown file, an unknown mode, a local shell missing a
  required kind, backend ignoring the folder, the neutral module byte for
  byte); `test_manifest.py` holds the install set, the version, the
  theme-provider split and runs the node suite.

## 1.32.1

* The Supacharge network site is named `supacharge.school`. Ray,
  2026-09-10, on rokct.ai's logos marquee: "logos in rokct are wrong.
  wrong names". The site is a `wordmark` entry - its name is drawn AS the
  brand, on rokct.ai's marquee and on every footer strip - and
  `NETWORK_SITES` (`components/custom/landing/network-sites.ts`) named it
  "Supacharge", a re-cased, shortened form of the brand string the product
  declares (lms_sdk's site-metadata `siteName`, under Ray's 2026-09-10
  ruling that the brand is written "supacharge.school", lowercase, wherever
  it is written as the brand). The entry now carries that string verbatim,
  and the rule sits on the `name` field: a name is the product's declared
  brand string, never shortened, re-cased or otherwise normalised here.
  `rokct.ai` and `juvo` are as Ray writes them and unchanged. Nothing else
  moves: a shell never lists itself, and Supacharge's own strip is off
  (lms_sdk's placement).
* Tests: `test_network_sites_list_shape` and `network-strip.test.mts` pin
  the three names verbatim and refuse "Supacharge".

## 1.32.0

* The landing renders server-side. Ray, 2026-09-10: "hero i think should
  be server side if not the whole landing". Until 1.31.0 the client
  orchestrator (`components/custom/landing-content.tsx`) loaded every
  registered section, the header menu and the hero copy in effects after
  mount, so the first HTML a visitor or a crawler got was the header
  chrome and an empty hero frame: no words, no section headings, no
  header links until the client bundle had run. Now:
  * `app/landing/page.tsx` does the registry work on the server, through
    the new `components/custom/landing/landing-page.ts`: every
    `PAGE_SECTIONS` entry is awaited (a module that fails to load is
    logged and skipped, exactly as the effect did), `meta.renders` is
    asked once, the sections are sorted (stable, registry order breaking
    ties), the floating nav is built, the header menu is resolved against
    it and the hero copy is overlaid. `resolveLandingPage(ctx)` is the
    loader, `arrangeLandingPage(loaded, ctx, menu)` the pure rule the node
    tests execute, `resolveHeroConfig()` the hero's half. The page renders
    the sections and the hero itself (server elements) and hands them,
    with the resolved menu, to the thin client wrapper.
  * `components/custom/landing-content.tsx` is that wrapper: it keeps only
    the search-active state that hides the sections while the hero shows
    results, and provides the setter to the hero through
    `HeroResultsContext` so no function crosses the server boundary as a
    prop. It loads nothing. Section modules stay in the home SDK; only
    where they are loaded moved - to the server, which is what the next
    bullet's contract follows from.
  * The server-safe section contract. The registry is imported on the
    server now, and on the server every export of a module that starts
    with `"use client"` is a client reference proxy: `meta.order`,
    `meta.nav`, `meta.renders` and `meta.rootClass` read as undefined, so
    a section fell back to its module name as its id and floating-nav
    label ("Scroll to lms-sessions-section"), the header's anchors did not
    resolve, a section `renders` would have dropped stayed on the page and
    the order broke - and the node tests, which load plain objects, never
    saw it. The contract, in one sentence: a section's ENTRY module (the
    one the registry imports) is server-safe - no `"use client"`, `meta`
    exported as a plain object and a default component - and anything
    that needs hooks, state, effects, browser APIs or framer-motion lives
    in a sibling `<name>.client.tsx` that starts with `"use client"` and
    that the entry's default export renders, with `meta.renders(ctx)` pure
    (no window, no localStorage). `loadPageSection` now checks `meta`
    before reading it (`describeMetaProblem`: React's
    `Symbol.for("react.client.reference")` tag or `$$typeof`/`$$id` own
    keys mark a client reference, a missing export is named, and anything
    else that is not a plain object is named for what it is) and, rather
    than dropping the section, renders it with `fallbackSectionMeta()` -
    order 100, the entry id as its DOM id, no floating-nav entry, always
    present, no rootClass - and one `console.warn` naming the section, the
    settings it renders with and the contract (`SECTION_ENTRY_CONTRACT`).
    So unsplit sections still render with default settings: a shell
    re-pinned to this base with a home SDK that has not split its entries
    yet keeps every section on the page (a client-reference default export
    renders fine from the server component; only its meta is unreadable),
    which is what 1.31.0 showed, less the nav tick a module name would
    label. base registers no section of its own and none of its installed
    modules exports a `meta` from a client module;
    `tests/test_manifest.py` scans every installed entry for that, and
    `tests/landing-page.test.mts` executes the fallback against a client
    reference, React's throwing deep proxy, a missing meta and every
    non-object.
  * `components/custom/hero.tsx` is the SERVER wrapper: `HERO_CONFIG` with
    the registered copy laid over it, awaited, handed as props to the new
    client view `components/custom/hero-view.tsx`, which draws the copy
    from props and keeps the word rotation, the visitor's branding cache
    (`localStorage`, read after mount) and the registered form
    client-side and hydration-safe (index 0 on both sides, no mismatch).
    The client copy load is gone; there is no pending "no words" state,
    because the words are known before the first byte. Framer's entrance
    animation is off on the elements that carry the copy (`initial={false}`
    on the wordmark block, the h1 and the badges block, and on the word's
    `AnimatePresence`), so the server's text is visible before hydration
    and without JavaScript; the word swap still animates on every rotation
    after the first. `fallbackHref`, HeroConfig's one function-typed
    field, cannot be a prop; the view resolves it beside the form that
    consumes it, in the form's own `next/dynamic` loader, so a registered
    copy's override still reaches the form. `hasBadgeIcon` is re-exported
    from `hero.tsx`.
  * The header's links and mega trigger are in the first HTML: the wrapper
    passes the menu the page resolved, and `Header` already prefers props.
  * `HeroConfig.brand?: "name" | "stem"` (default `"name"`; no visible
    change on any shell until a home SDK's hero copy declares it). `"stem"`
    renders `brandStemOf(PLATFORM_NAME)` - the whole name when it has no
    dot - as the wordmark's visible text, sized to the slot, with the full
    name on the element's `aria-label` and `title`; resolved on the server
    (`resolveHeroWordmark`), so the first HTML carries the stem. No brand
    string and no hostname in base.
  * `PageSectionMeta.rootClass?: string`: class names the landing root
    carries from the first HTML, every present section's value joined in
    page order. The seam for a home SDK whose theme section puts its token
    class on the document from a client effect: server-rendered copy would
    otherwise first paint unthemed. The effect may keep running for what
    only `<html>` can carry (a mode default, a mirror attribute).
  * Installs: `components/custom/hero-view.tsx` and
    `components/custom/landing/landing-page.ts`. No new dependency.
  * Tests: `tests/landing-page.test.mts` (node, run by
    `tests/test_manifest.py`) executes `arrangeLandingPage` (skip, renders,
    stable order, overlays/flow, nav ends, menu against the live nav,
    rootClass), `describeMetaProblem`/`isClientReference` and the
    client-reference fallback, and `resolveHeroWordmark`/`resolveHeroConfig`
    with an `acme.school` fixture; `test_manifest.py` holds that the page, the
    wrapper and the view load no section, menu or copy in an effect and
    that the view renders the copy from props with `initial={false}` on
    the h1.

## 1.31.0

* The country code beside a stem wordmark follows the stem's size. Ray,
  2026-09-10: "look at rokct header's country code and then check
  supacharge's". Beside a mark the code is the 36px rokct.ai's old header
  set it at, against a 44px mark that is the same on every viewport, so
  it is always the smaller of the two; beside a stem wordmark (1.29.0),
  which `BRAND_STEM_FONT_SIZE` shrinks to fit the bar, the 36px code
  outgrew the wordmark on a phone (17 characters at 390: a 21px stem
  beside a 36px code, the code's capitals half again the wordmark's
  height and 8px below its baseline) while at 1280 the two shells drew
  the code the same (36px, medium, foreground, 4px after the brand, a
  25px capital). rokct.ai keeps everything its old host header had and
  Supacharge inherits it; what Supacharge did not inherit was the code
  being the smaller element, so:
  * `components/custom/landing/header-menu.ts`:
    `BRAND_STEM_CODE_FONT_SIZE`, `min(36px, <BRAND_STEM_FONT_SIZE>)` -
    the 36px wherever the stem is at least that (a 5-letter name at 60px,
    17 characters at 1280), else the stem's own size (17 characters: 21px
    at 390, 29px at 768). Pure CSS over the same `--brand-chars`.
  * `components/custom/header.tsx`: `CollapsingBrand` sets it inline on
    the code, with `--brand-chars`, only when the brand folds to a stem,
    and lays the code out as the stem is (centred, `leading-none`, the
    same `pt-0.5`) so it sits on the stem's baseline at every width. The
    code beside a mark (rokct.ai) or a letter tile keeps its 1.24.0
    class and inline style, literal for literal, and a declaration's own
    `code.style` still wins.
* Tests: `header-brand.test.mts` pins `BRAND_STEM_CODE_FONT_SIZE` (36px
  where the stem is 36px or larger, the stem's size where it is smaller,
  never larger than either, for names of 1 to 30 characters at 320 to
  1920) and reads the staged `header.tsx` for where it is applied;
  `test_header_code_follows_the_stem_wordmark` holds the two branches'
  literals, the untouched slot and the stem wordmark.

## 1.30.0

* A tenant's BACKEND custom domain, from the host resolver (Ray,
  2026-09-10). A tenant may have, besides the shell domain that opens
  its portal, a domain of its own that its backend answers on, so it
  keeps working when the platform's own zone is down - protection, not a
  new identity. The control site's `resolve_site_by_host` returns
  `backend_url` (a scheme'd origin) beside `site_name` while that domain
  is Active, and the kernel keeps the two apart:
  * `app/services/base/tenant-host-control.ts`: the answer is parsed as
    a pair, `TenantHostSite { siteName, backendUrl? }`, by the new
    `resolveTenantHost(host)`; the positive cache holds the pair
    (`cachedTenantHost`). A `backend_url` that is malformed, not an
    http(s) origin, not a public host, the control site, or the site
    itself is dropped and the site name still answers; only its origin
    is kept (no path). `resolveTenantSiteByHost` and
    `resolveTenantSiteForRequest` answer the SITE NAME as before, so the
    `x-rokct-tenant-site` header auth_sdk's middleware forwards never
    carries the backend origin. The registered
    `controlTenantHostResolver` answers the backend origin when control
    named one (already scheme'd, so `normalizeSiteUrl` keeps it), else
    the site name as before; `ROKCT_TENANT_HOSTS` entries are unchanged
    and name no backend.
  * Stale-while-error, same module: every positive answer is also kept
    for `TENANT_HOST_STALE_TTL_MS` (24 h, `ROKCT_TENANT_HOST_STALE_TTL_MS`,
    `0` switches it off) beyond the 5-minute positive TTL. When control
    is UNREACHABLE - a network error, a timeout, a 5xx - the last known
    answer for that host is served instead of "unknown host" (for the
    negative TTL, so control is asked again soon). A 4xx, or control
    reached and saying the host is nobody's, is a definitive answer and
    replaces the stale one. Per process, in memory: an instance that
    never saw a host while control was up still answers the storefront.
  * `alternateTenantOrigin(origin)` (the other half of a known pair,
    both ways, kept for the stale TTL) and `sameTenantOrigin(a, b)`
    (same site, or the two halves of one pair) are exported for the
    gateway; all new names are re-exported from `index.ts`.
  * `app/services/base/platform-gateway.ts`: `platformCall` retries a
    RESOLVED origin ONCE on the other half of the pair when the first
    attempt fails at the network level (a fetch error, a timeout - the
    retry gets its own timeout budget) or with a 502/503/504: a backend
    origin falls back on the site name, a site name on the backend
    origin (known for the session's site once this process resolved the
    tenant's shell host). Never on a 4xx or any other status (that is
    the tenant's answer), never for an explicit `baseUrl` (that call
    asked for one specific origin), never a third origin; the alternate's
    own outcome is final. The credential guard is `sameTenantOrigin`: a
    session's credentials reach its site's origin or that site's backend
    origin, nothing else. Logged once per alternate origin.
  * Tests: `tests/tenant-host-control.test.mts` gains the backend
    origin (parsing, the cached pair, the resolver answering the origin,
    the header still the site name, unusable backends dropped, the pair
    both ways) and stale-while-error (network error, 5xx, 4xx is
    definitive, a definite "nobody's" forgets it, off at 0, its own TTL);
    new `tests/platform-gateway.test.mts` (retry once on a network error
    / timeout / 502-504, no retry on 4xx or 500, exactly two attempts,
    the retry's own signal, GET keeps its query, the reverse direction
    with credentials, no pair means one attempt, credentials never to a
    third origin, explicit `baseUrl` never retried), staged by
    `test_manifest.py` with session.ts's host seam stood in by a null
    session. The contract test follows the new exports.

## 1.29.0

* Supacharge network site moves to https://supacharge.school (Ray,
  2026-09-10). `NETWORK_SITES` url, tests and the first-party host
  allowlist updated. No visible change on any shell; the marquee and
  footer strip link to the new host after re-pin.
* An icon-less collapsing brand whose platform name carries a dot folds
  to its stem. Ray, 2026-09-10: "same on the nextjs is if sitename has a
  dot, fold dot and what comes after so they s will never show anymore
  unless there is icon, if there is icon it fold further to leave only
  icon". So:
  * `components/custom/landing/header-menu.ts`: `brandStemOf(name)`, the
    text before the first dot of the trimmed name (`"a.b.c"` gives `"a"`,
    `"x."` gives `"x"`; `null` for no dot, a leading dot or no name - not
    dotted for this rule), and `brandFoldsToStem(brand, name)`: a
    collapsing brand whose logo resolved to `"none"`, with its wordmark
    on, whose name has a stem. Base names no brand string; whatever name
    the shell shows is the one that folds.
  * `components/custom/header.tsx`: `BrandStemWordmark`, asked by
    `CollapsingBrand` before the 1.28.0 letter tile: the whole
    `PLATFORM_NAME` at load, as text in the large wordmark's classes (the
    ones the `Branding` slot takes) at the host wordmarks' bold weight,
    and after `delayMs` the dot and what follows SLIDE into the stem,
    leaving the stem as the wordmark with the code and the chevron beside
    it. Ray, 2026-09-10: "its like its being erased but not as a back type
    but like sliding into what gets left. i think rokct already use the
    animation in header" - so it is the large wordmark slot's own slide
    (500ms ease-in-out, width closing over hidden overflow), the suffix's
    slot a one-column grid whose track goes `1fr` to `0fr` so it closes
    from the suffix's own width with nothing measured, and the stem's
    glyphs never move: no backspace, no swap. The wordmark's size is
    responsive (`BRAND_STEM_FONT_SIZE` in `header-menu.ts`, set inline
    with `--brand-chars`, the full name's character count): the large
    wordmark's 60px when the whole name fits, else what fits a budget of
    20vw + 140px at 0.6em per character - one size for the name and its
    stem, so a long dotted name never widens the bar before the fold nor
    pushes the burger off a phone after it (17 characters: about 21px at
    390, 29px at 768, 39px at 1280; 5 letters at 1280 stay at 60px).
    Pure CSS, nothing measured. The letter tile is never
    drawn for a dotted name. A brand with a declared
    image, a registered icon or the host's own mark still folds to that
    mark whatever its name; an undotted icon-less name still folds to the
    1.28.0 tile; a still brand is untouched. The favicon route is not
    part of this.
* Tests: `header-brand.test.mts` - the stem for dotted, multi-dot,
  trailing-dot, leading-dot, undotted and empty names, and the fold rule
  for the three cases (a dotted name without an icon, an icon whatever
  the name, no dot and no icon) with the edge cases;
  `test_header_folds_a_dotted_name_to_its_stem` reads the stem wordmark
  (text only, the suffix slot closing with the collapse, the responsive
  size set once on the span both stem and suffix inherit from and no
  60px class on it, asked before the tile, no brand string in code) and
  holds the 1.28.0 literals; `header-brand.test.mts` also pins
  `BRAND_STEM_FONT_SIZE` (the widths it bounds for 17 characters at 390,
  768 and 1280, a 5-letter name at 1280, the stem beside the burger at
  390) and reads the staged `header.tsx` for where it is applied.

## 1.28.0

* A collapsing brand with no image folds into a letter tile. Ray,
  2026-09-10, on supacharge.app: "rokctai has logo and name that the name
  fold into logo and menus disapear, this is not in supacharge. since
  supacharge has not icon cant it fold and only leave the first letter as
  its icon?" A shell that declares `brand.logo: "none"` (the wordmark is
  the logo) and `brand.collapse` had nothing to fold into: `BrandMark`
  draws nothing for `"none"`, so after `delayMs` the header was left with
  the code and the chevron alone. So:
  * `components/custom/header.tsx`: `BrandLetterTile`, drawn by
    `CollapsingBrand` in the mark's slot when the brand folds to a letter.
    The platform name's first letter (the same `PLATFORM_NAME` the
    wordmark shows) in the shell's `primary` token on the generated
    /brand-icon tab tile's ground (`#0b0b0b` with its highlight, the same
    in both themes, as the tab's icon is), 44px square like a mark,
    corners at 22% and the face at 84% of the square - the tab tile's
    proportions - `role="img"` with the name as its label. CSS and text
    only: no `<img>`, nothing fetched. Its slot opens with the collapse,
    the way the code's does, so at load the wordmark stands alone as the
    declaration says and the name then folds into the letter; the code
    and the chevron sit beside it and the desktop nav fades and returns
    exactly as in 1.24.0.
  * `components/custom/landing/header-menu.ts`: `brandLetterOf(name)`, the
    tab tile's rule restated for the browser bundle (first letter or
    digit, any script, uppercased; `""` for none), and
    `brandFoldsToLetter(brand)`: a collapsing brand whose logo resolved to
    `"none"`, and nothing else. A shell that declares no `collapse`
    renders byte-for-byte what it did (`resolveHeaderBrand` answers the
    same shape); a collapsing brand with a declared image, a registered
    icon or the host's own mark keeps folding to that mark.
* Tests: `header-brand.test.mts` - the letter for a capitalised, a
  lowercase, a digit-led and an empty name, and the fold rule for `"none"`
  with and without a collapse, for a declared image, a registered icon
  and the host mark, and the unchanged resolved shape without a collapse;
  `test_header_folds_to_a_letter_tile_for_an_icon_less_shell` reads the
  tile (text in the primary token, no image, the tab tile's ground and
  proportions, opened by the collapse) and holds the still brand's and the
  mark branches' literals.

## 1.27.0

* The network strip renders once per page. Ray, 2026-09-09, on rokct.ai:
  "we now have two trusted by". The shell's layout draws its footer on
  every route, `/landing` included, so a registered landing placement
  (`afterHero`) and `footer: true` both landed on the same page - the
  placement rule knew the surface, not the page. So:
  * `networkStripRendersAt(strip, surface, onLandingPage = false)`: the
    footer surface yields on the landing route whenever the landing
    placement is not `"none"` (the page already carries the strip). Every
    other route keeps the footer strip; a shell that registers nothing
    (landing `"none"`, footer on) sees no change anywhere.
  * `isLandingRoute(pathname)` and `LANDING_ROUTE = "/landing"` in
    `components/custom/landing/network-strip.ts` - the pure half;
    `components/custom/network-strip.tsx` reads `usePathname()` itself,
    so neither `FooterChromeRow` nor a host footer that renders
    `<NetworkStrip surface="footer" />` needs to know. A render outside
    the App Router (`null` pathname) counts as any other route.
  * A fourth landing placement, `"section"`: a page section the home SDK
    registered draws the strip itself, in its own look (rokct.ai's logos
    marquee, agent_sdk 1.17.0), reading `loadResolvedNetworkStrip()` and
    asking `networkStripRendersAt(strip, "section")`; base's `afterHero`
    and `beforeFooter` surfaces then draw nothing and the footer still
    yields on `/landing`. `NetworkStripSurface` gains the value with it.
  * Nothing about the list, the links or the heading changes: a link is
    still the site's origin, no parameter, no handler.
* Tests: `network-strip.test.mts` covers `isLandingRoute`, the footer
  yielding on the landing route only while a landing placement is set,
  the `"section"` surface, and the unchanged defaults;
  `test_network_strip_registry_contract` names the four placements and the
  two new exports, `test_network_strip_component_never_tracks` holds that
  the component reads the route through `usePathname` and asks the pure
  rule, and `test_network_strip_renders_once_per_page` reads the rule.

## 1.26.0

* Base ships the platform brand marks itself. Ray, 2026-09-09, on the
  store logos agent_sdk 1.15.0 (Chrome Web Store, Google Play) and lms_sdk
  1.16.0 (Google Play, AppGallery, App Store, Windows) each installed under
  their own `public/brand/marks/`: "move to base, home sdk can choose to
  use them or not". So:
  * `templates/public/brand/marks/` - `chrome-web-store.svg` (4353 B, the
    agent_sdk drawing), `google-play.svg` (1181 B, lms_sdk's gilbarbara
    tracing; the same four Google colours as agent's), `app-gallery.svg`
    (1342 B, Huawei red), `app-store.svg` (687 B, Apple, `currentColor`),
    `windows.svg` (218 B, four equal panes, `currentColor`) - installed as
    a directory to `public/brand/marks/`, so every host that pins base
    serves `/brand/marks/<name>.svg`. Only the `marks/` subdirectory is
    base's; a home SDK's own `public/brand` mapping (lms's wordmarks) is
    untouched. Each file: a `viewBox`, no `<script>`, no `href`, no host
    but the SVG namespace (`test_brand_marks_are_installed`).
  * `components/custom/landing/brand-marks.ts`, a typed registry a home
    SDK may use or ignore: `BrandMark { src, alt, mono }`, `BRAND_MARKS`
    keyed `chromeWebStore | googlePlay | appGallery | appStore | windows`,
    and the dark-mode rule - `isMonoMark(src)` / `markImageClass(src)`.
    Opting in is handing a mark to a hero badge's `icon` (hero-copy.ts)
    or a header action's `icon` (header-menu.ts), typed
    (`icon: BRAND_MARKS.chromeWebStore`) or as the bare path; nothing in
    base draws one by default.
  * Dark mode, once, in base: the two monochrome marks are `currentColor`
    inside an `<img>`, an isolated document, so they resolve black in both
    themes. `hero.tsx` (a badge's image icon) and `header-menu.tsx` (an
    action's image icon) now add `dark:invert` to exactly the image whose
    src path is `/brand/marks/app-store.svg` or `/brand/marks/windows.svg`
    (`markImageClass`: trimmed, `?query`/`#hash` ignored, absolute URLs
    never match). Coloured marks and every other image are never filtered.
    A home SDK must NOT add its own invert for these paths: lms_sdk
    1.16.0's `lms-theme.css` rule for the same two files is retired in
    lms_sdk 1.17.0.
  * Defaults unchanged: `HERO_CONFIG`'s badges keep the built-in "chrome"
    and "app-store" glyphs, the Google Play badge still names no icon, the
    header's actions name no image - a shell that declares nothing renders
    1.25.0's DOM.
  * Tests: `test_brand_marks_are_installed`,
    `test_brand_marks_registry_contract`,
    `test_brand_marks_behaviour_under_node` (`brand-marks.test.mts`) and
    `test_brand_marks_type_check_under_tsc`; the 1.25.0 image-icon test
    follows the class merge.

## 1.25.0

* A header action may carry an IMAGE icon the shell serves itself. Ray,
  2026-09-09, on the Chrome Web Store mark rokct.ai's old host header
  hot-linked from a third party's CDN for its "Add ROK Extension" button
  (and which the 1.24.0 restore left out for that reason): "i dont think
  merlin owns [the icon] so use it but bring it local". Base never names a
  third-party host, so the home SDK installs the file under `public/` and
  names its path:
  * `HeaderMenuImage` (`components/custom/landing/header-menu.ts`):
    `{ src, alt }`, the shape a hero badge's `icon` already takes in
    `hero-config.ts`. `HeaderMenuAction.icon` is now
    `HeaderMenuIcon | HeaderMenuImage`; a link's and a resolved item's
    icon stay the closed glyph set.
  * `components/custom/header-menu.tsx`: `actionIcon()` answers the named
    glyph, the image when it has a src, or nothing; `HeaderMenuActions`
    draws the image as a plain `<img>` (the way `header.tsx` draws a
    declared brand image) at the glyph slot's 20px, `object-contain`,
    before the label, in both the bar and the stacked mobile layout. No
    `next/image`, no dark-mode filter: the mark is a multi-colour drawing
    and the old header drew it as it was in both themes. A named glyph
    renders as it did in 1.20.0; an action without an icon, or with an
    empty src, renders the label alone - a shell that declares no image
    renders identical DOM to 1.24.0.
  * Tests: `test_header_menu_action_carries_an_image_icon`, the 1.20.0
    glyph test updated for the widened type, and two node cases in
    `header-brand.test.mts` (`resolveHeaderMenu` carries an image icon
    verbatim, beside a glyph and beside none).
  * Downstream: agent_sdk 1.15.0 installs `/brand/marks/chrome-web-store.svg`
    and sets it on rokct.ai's extension action; it needs this floor.

## 1.24.0

* The header's mega menu no longer closes before the pointer reaches it.
  Ray, on supacharge.app, 2026-09-09: "it is impossible to choose links if
  mega menu is open, it leaves no moment to move mouse". Two faults in
  `components/custom/header-menu.tsx`'s `DesktopMegaMenu`, both fixed at
  the source, so every composed shell gets the same menu:
  * A DEAD STRIP between trigger and panel. The bar (`header.tsx`, `h-16`)
    centres the desktop nav, which had no height of its own, so the menu's
    hover wrapper - the element carrying `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave` -
    was as tall as the bar's text (bottom edge at 42px) while the panel
    hangs from the bar's bottom edge (top at 64px). Moving straight down
    from the word to the panel crossed 22px of bar that belonged to
    neither, and the leave closed the panel on the spot. `HeaderMenuNav`
    is now `h-full`, so the wrapper spans the bar and meets the panel edge
    to edge (the measured gap is 0px); inside the legacy `HeaderMenuRow`
    the parent has no set height and the class is inert. No visual change:
    the trigger sits where it did, the panel draws where it did.
  * NO HOVER INTENT. A leave closed at once. It now starts a
    `HOVER_CLOSE_DELAY_MS` (200ms) timer that re-entering the wrapper or
    the panel, focusing the trigger or clicking it cancels, so brushing an
    edge or overshooting a corner is not a close. Escape, a click outside,
    focus leaving the menu and a click on one of its links still close at
    once; the timer is cleared on unmount. Touch and the burger panel's
    stacked list are untouched.
  * Also fixed while here: Escape pressed on one of the panel's links
    returned focus to the trigger and re-opened the panel, because the
    trigger's `onFocus` (which opens) fired after the close. The handler
    now focuses first and closes second.
  * Tests: `test_header_menu_hover_intent` ties the wrapper's leave to the
    delayed close and its enter to the cancel, the nav to `h-full`, and the
    Escape handler to the focus-then-close order.
* The header's brand may BADGE and COLLAPSE again. Ray, 2026-09-09, on
  rokct.ai after its re-pin to base_sdk 1.21.0: "header lost functions the
  old rokct header had"; the standing ruling is that rokct.ai keeps
  everything its old host header (rokctai_frontend's hand-written
  `components/custom/header.tsx`, 668 lines, before its PR #143) had. Set
  against that file, the shared header had dropped three things around
  the brand and one button style; all four are back, each behind the home
  SDK's declaration so a shell that declares nothing (Supacharge) renders
  byte-for-byte what it did:
  * `HeaderBrand.badge` (`components/custom/landing/header-menu.ts`):
    the host's `brand-logo.tsx` is drawn with `showBadge` - rokct.ai's
    BETA strip, which its old header always passed (`showBadge={true}`).
    Every shell's brand-logo.tsx accepts the prop (the `requires` contract;
    Supacharge's and delivery's accept it and draw nothing).
  * `HeaderBrand.collapse` (`true`, or a `HeaderBrandCollapse`): the old
    header's brand motion - the mark at 44px, the wordmark at
    `text-[60px] tracking-tighter` in a 250px slot that closes 1500ms
    after mount (`delayMs`), a chevron after the mark once it has, and the
    visitor's COUNTRY CODE sliding in beside the mark at the same moment
    (`code`, a client-side resolver the home SDK supplies, answering the
    text or `{ text, style }`; rokct.ai reads its branding cache exactly
    as the old header's `getBrandingSync()` did). The desktop nav fades
    with the wordmark and comes back while the pointer is over the header
    or the page is scrolled past 10px - the old `navVisible` rule verbatim.
    `resolveHeaderBrand` carries `badge` and `collapse` (defaults filled
    by the new `resolveHeaderBrandCollapse`) on `ResolvedHeaderBrand`;
    `header.tsx` renders a collapsing brand through `CollapsingBrand`, runs
    the timer and the scroll/hover listeners only when one is declared
    (`useBrandCollapse`), and wraps the nav in the fading element only
    then. Colours are theme tokens (`text-foreground`,
    `text-muted-foreground`), not the old header's zinc/gray.
  * `HeaderMenuAction.variant` gains `"secondary"`: the filled muted
    button (`bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground`) the old header drew
    its "Chat with ROK" nav button as (`bg-zinc-700`), beside `primary`
    and the outlined `ghost`. `header-menu.tsx`'s `HeaderMenuActions`
    paints it in both layouts.
  * Not restored, on purpose, and listed here so nobody hunts for them:
    the old bar's `max-w-screen-2xl px-6 md:px-12` container (shared
    chrome; 32px wider at 1280 than the `max-w-6xl` bar every shell has),
    the old mobile panel's `text-2xl` link size (the shared panel lists
    more and uses `text-lg`), the old panel's 200ms fade-and-slide (the
    shared panel toggles `hidden` so `aria-controls` always resolves), the
    old mobile CTA's hard-coded `#4f46e5` (theme tokens only) and the
    Chrome Web Store icon hot-linked from a third party's CDN (the lucide
    `chrome` glyph since 1.20.0).
  * Tests: `test_header_brand_badge_and_collapse` ties the registry's
    fields, the header's `CollapsingBrand` / `useBrandCollapse` and the
    still-brand literals to the source, and `header-brand.test.mts`
    executes `resolveHeaderBrandCollapse` and the carried defaults.

## 1.23.0

* The NETWORK STRIP: the other sites of the Rokct network, each a link,
  under a "Trusted by" heading, on every composed shell minus itself.
  Ray, 2026-09-09: rokct.ai must not list his other products as choices
  (each has moved to its own shell), but a founder landing on rokct.ai's
  free opportunities pages must still learn about them - a clickable logo
  strip, and the heading is his wording ("these products already trust
  rokct as they run on it"). He also asked whether rokct's existing
  `logos` section is enough. It is not: agent_sdk's `logos.tsx` is a
  marquee of Walmart, Cisco, Netflix, Pinterest, Zoom, Sony, Ebay and
  Uber images hotlinked from a third party's CDN (a chat template's
  leftover), none of them a link, on the landing page only. That section
  is left in place (an unused surface is flagged, never removed).
  * `components/custom/landing/network-sites.ts` is the ONE list:
    rokct.ai (https://rokct.ai), Supacharge (https://supacharge.app,
    `wordmark: true` until Ray designs an icon) and juvo
    (https://juvo.app), plus `hosting` and `telephony` with `url: null`
    and `shown: false` until Ray picks their domains (Ray, 2026-09-09:
    "hosting will get a name when i decide on domain"). An entry is
    `{ key, name, url, logo?, logoDark?, wordmark?, shown? }`; the logos
    are read from each site's own `/images/logo_dark.svg` (the black
    glyph, for the light page) and `/images/logo.svg` (the white glyph,
    for the dark page; the shells name the two after the TILE their
    brand-logo.tsx draws them on, not the page), so a mark changes in
    one place, on its own site. `resolveNetworkSites
    (sites, { selfHost, order, hidden })` is the pure rule: every shown
    entry with a URL, minus the shell whose host matches `selfHost`
    (`networkSiteHost()` normalises a URL's host exactly as
    `resolveDisplayHost` does, through the kernel's `normaliseHost`:
    port dropped, `www.` dropped, lower-cased), minus the hidden keys, the
    named order first and the rest in list order. `hasTrackingParameters()`
    names the line no link may cross: no entry carries, and no rule adds,
    a query string or a fragment.
  * `components/custom/landing/network-strip.ts` is an eighth one-marker
    registry, `// @rokct-sdk-network-strip-start`, single-answer and
    home-SDK-owned like `header-menu.ts`: a home SDK registers a module
    whose default export is a `NetworkStripConfig` - `heading`, `order`,
    `hidden` (site keys), `placement: { landing?: "afterHero" |
    "beforeFooter" | "none"; footer?: boolean }` - with one line,
    `{ id: "<sdk>-network-strip", load: () => import("@/components/custom/
    landing/<file>") }`. `resolveNetworkStrip(config, selfHost)` lays it
    over the defaults - heading "Trusted by", list order, nothing hidden,
    `footer: true`, `landing: "none"` - and `networkStripRendersAt(strip,
    surface)` is the one test of where the strip draws: the footer while
    `footer` is on, a landing surface only when `landing` names it, never
    with no site left. Nothing registered is the default, so lms_sdk, the
    hosting and the delivery home SDKs need no change to get the strip in
    their footer row minus themselves.
  * `components/custom/network-strip.tsx` draws it: `<NetworkStrip
    surface="afterHero" | "beforeFooter" | "footer" />`, the heading as
    an eyebrow and one link per site - the logo when the site has one
    (its dark twin under `dark:`, the name as text if the image will not
    load) else the name as text - each `href` the site's own origin with
    `rel="noopener"`, no query string, no click handler, no ad network.
    Generic chrome in the footer row's mould: neutral alphas only, no
    product name, no brand hue. The shell it draws on is left out by host
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` first, else the `url` registered in
    `site-metadata.ts` - the CONFIGURED site, not the request host, since
    a white-label domain in front of the same deployment is still the
    same product. The config and the host are resolved once per module
    and rendered through `next/dynamic`, as the header renders its brand,
    so the strip is server-rendered with the page and never pops in.
  * WHERE it hooks in. Base has no footer component to hook: the shells
    own their footers (rokctai_frontend's host `footer.tsx`, lms_sdk's
    `lms-footer-section.tsx`) and base ships only the copyright row they
    end with (`footer-chrome.tsx`, 1.12.0). So that row is the footer
    hook: `FooterChromeRow` draws `<NetworkStrip surface="footer" />`
    above itself, inside one fragment, and gains `networkStrip?: boolean`
    (default true) for a footer that places the strip itself. The
    landing page's two surfaces are `landing-content.tsx`'s: right under
    the hero and right before the footer anchor, both inside the block
    that hides while the hero shows search results.
  * rokct.ai: agent_sdk 1.13.0 registers `placement: { landing:
    "afterHero", footer: true }`, so the strip sits under the hero on
    /landing and in every footer that renders the row. rokctai_frontend's
    host `footer.tsx` does not yet render `FooterChromeRow` (it keeps its
    own copy of the copyright row) and must adopt it - or render
    `<NetworkStrip surface="footer" />` itself - for the strip to reach
    the pages outside /landing; that is a host edit, flagged here.
    supacharge.app: lms_sdk registers nothing and the footer section's
    row shows rokct.ai and juvo, never Supacharge.
  * Base's own third-party defaults come out with it. Ray, 2026-09-09:
    "everything served from another company cdn tells you is placeholder".
    `components/custom/landing/hero-config.ts` named four assets from a
    chat template's CDN (`cdn.getmerlin.in`): the gradient behind the
    hero (a 502 today, and at 30% opacity in dark mode - the default now),
    the Chrome Web Store and Google Play badge icons, and the claim
    "Trusted by 20M+ users" beside them. `backgroundImage` is `""` (the
    hero already hides the block on an empty string), `trustLine` is `[]`
    (the network strip is what stands under the hero now), the Chrome
    badge's icon is the new built-in `"chrome"` glyph (lucide's own mark,
    the one the header's extension button draws since 1.20.0) and the
    Google Play badge has no icon. `HeroBadge.icon` is optional and
    `hero.tsx` draws only a badge that has one (`hasBadgeIcon`: a built-in
    glyph, or an image with a `src`), because below `md` a badge shows its
    icon alone and would otherwise be an empty pill - so the Google Play
    badge waits for a home SDK's hero copy to give it an icon rather than
    base inventing one. Every home-SDK override path is unchanged: a
    registered `HeroCopy` may still set a background, a trust line and
    image icons of its own.
  * `tests/test_manifest.py` asserts that no default under `templates/`
    or `src/` references a third-party host (an allowlist of the
    network's own sites, the licence URL, the social origins the admin
    settings page links and the documentation examples), the four hero
    defaults, and the badge rule.
  * `tests/test_manifest.py` also asserts the installs, the registry's
    marker and contract, the two landing surfaces and the footer hook,
    that the component names no tracking parameter, and stages the list,
    the registry and the kernel under node (22.6+, type-stripping) to
    execute `tests/network-strip.test.mts`: the list's shape (unique keys, https
    origins with no query string, `url: null` only with `shown: false`),
    self-exclusion by host (`https://www.rokct.ai:443/` leaves rokct out;
    supacharge's host leaves Supacharge out; no host leaves every site
    in), the order and hidden rules, that a link is never given a
    tracking parameter, and that `landing: "none"` hides both landing
    surfaces while `footer: false` hides the footer.

## 1.22.0

* The shells default to DARK. Ray, 2026-09-09: "default to dark mode".
  base_sdk never shipped the theme seam: each shell carried its own
  pass-through `components/custom/theme-provider.tsx` over next-themes and
  its root layout chose the default alone - supacharge-web's `app/layout.tsx`
  with `defaultTheme="dark"`, rokctai_frontend's with `defaultTheme="system"`
  and `enableSystem`, so rokct.ai opened in whatever the visitor's OS said.
  The rule now lives in base, once, for every shell the composer lands it on.
  * `components/custom/theme-provider.tsx` is a new `installs` entry (the
    composer overwrites the shell copies, as it did the header in 1.14.0): a
    client wrapper over next-themes' `ThemeProvider` whose defaults are
    `defaultTheme="dark"` and `attribute="class"` (the signal Tailwind's
    `darkMode: ["class"]` reads), exported alongside as `DEFAULT_THEME` and
    `THEME_ATTRIBUTE`. A first visit with no stored preference paints dark
    whatever the OS says; a preference the visitor already expressed through
    the header's toggle (next-themes' `theme` key in localStorage) is
    honoured exactly as before, and the toggle keeps flipping light and dark.
    Every other next-themes prop (`enableSystem`, `disableTransitionOnChange`,
    `storageKey`) is the host's to pass; with `enableSystem` on, "system"
    stays a value a toggle may select, it is only no longer what an
    unexpressed preference resolves to. The props type is imported from the
    "next-themes" package root (0.4.x ships no `dist/types` entry point).
  * `next-themes` `^0.4.6` joins the manifest's `dependencies` - both shells
    already pin it.
  * The `requires` note for `app/layout.tsx` states the contract: mount
    `<ThemeProvider>` from `@/components/custom/theme-provider`, pass no
    `defaultTheme` (or `"dark"`), keep `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>`.
    A layout passing `"light"` or `"system"` overrides the platform rule and
    is a host regression to fix in the shell. Follow-up: rokctai_frontend's
    `app/layout.tsx` lines 69-74 pass `defaultTheme="system"` today.
  * Tests: `test_theme_provider_is_installed_and_defaults_to_dark` ties the
    install to the template and asserts the dark default, the class
    attribute, the next-themes dependency and the layout contract;
    `test_theme_provider_type_checks_under_tsc` type-checks the staged
    template against next-themes' prop shape when a tsc is reachable.

## 1.21.0

* The home SDK declares what the header's brand slot draws. Ray,
  2026-09-09: "i saw supacharge got a s logo in header, let home sdk
  declare if it needs logo there or not. supacharge text is the logo
  right now until i design an icon". The "S" is supacharge-web's own
  `components/custom/brand-logo.tsx` (a `requires` file), an asset-free
  placeholder that draws the platform's first letter on a dark square,
  which the header has rendered beside the wordmark since 1.14.0 shipped
  it (`<BrandLogo width={32} height={32} />`); base had no way for a home
  SDK to say the slot should be empty, and no way to put a real icon there
  without a host edit.
  * `components/custom/landing/header-menu.ts`: `HeaderMenu` gains
    `brand?: HeaderBrand` - `{ logo?: "auto" | "none" | <path>;
    wordmark?: boolean }` - in the registry a home SDK already answers,
    under the same first-entry rule. `"none"` draws no image (the
    wordmark, the host's `branding.tsx`, IS the logo); a path
    (`/images/logo.svg`, or an absolute URL) draws that image at 32px; and
    `"auto"` (the default, and what a menu that declares nothing gets)
    draws a REAL icon only: the copy's registered `icon` from
    `site-metadata.ts` when there is one, else the host shell's own
    `brand-logo.tsx` - the mark every shell drew before this field
    existed. The generated `/brand-icon` letter tile (1.17.0) is for the
    browser tab and the share card only and is NEVER drawn in the header,
    not even when a declaration or a registered `icon` names it (it falls
    through to the "auto" rule). `wordmark: false` drops the wordmark for
    a shell whose image already spells its name. `resolveHeaderBrand(brand,
    copy)` is the pure rule, `headerBrandNeedsCopy()` says when the copy
    is consulted (only "auto"), `isGeneratedBrandIcon()` names the refused
    tile and `loadHeaderBrand()` loads the menu, then the copy only when
    needed, and never throws.
  * `components/custom/header.tsx` renders the brand link through
    `next/dynamic` the way `hero.tsx` renders the form: the declaration is
    resolved once per module and server-rendered with the bar, so the
    first paint already carries the declared mark and the "S" never
    flashes before it goes. With nothing registered in either registry
    there is no loader and the slot is the host's mark and wordmark as
    before. The header never imports `app/lib/site-metadata.ts` (it
    reaches for `node:fs`); the tile path is restated in the registry.
    Every prop of `Header` is unchanged.
  * rokct.ai: agent_sdk's menu declares no `brand` and its copy registers
    no `icon`, so the header draws rokctai_frontend's own `brand-logo.tsx`
    (`/images/logo.svg` with its dark variant) exactly as before - no
    agent_sdk change is needed to keep the logo. supacharge.app: lms_sdk
    1.13.0 declares `brand: { logo: "none" }` and the header is the
    wordmark alone.
  * `tests/test_manifest.py` asserts the declaration and the header's
    use of it, and stages `header-menu.ts` under node (22.6+,
    type-stripping) to execute `tests/header-brand.test.mts`: "none" draws
    no image, a path draws that src, "auto" with no real icon draws the
    host's mark with no src and never `/brand-icon`, "auto" with a
    registered `copy.icon` draws that src, the tile is refused however it
    is named, and a menu that fails to load is skipped.
* Fixed: `app/lib/site-metadata.ts` imports the `HeaderReader` type it
  uses (shell builds without `ignoreBuildErrors` failed on 1.20.0).
  1.20.0 moved the host predicate into the kernel and imported
  `isPublicHost`, `normaliseHost` and `requestHost` from
  `@/app/services/base/tenant-hosts`, but `resolveDisplayHost`'s
  signature still names `HeaderReader`, and the
  `export { ... type HeaderReader }` re-export at the bottom of the file
  does not put that name in scope: `next build` on a composed shell
  stopped at `site-metadata.ts(157,12): TS2304: Cannot find name
  'HeaderReader'` (found by the hosting shell build). The import now
  carries `type HeaderReader`.
  * `tests/test_manifest.py` guards the class of miss two ways: a
    stdlib check that every name the file re-exports from the kernel
    and also uses in its own code is imported, and a real `tsc` pass
    (strict, isolatedModules - the shells' tsconfig) over a staged copy
    of the file with the kernel's `tenant-hosts.ts`, the landing
    registry and `next`/`node:*` stubs beside it, run whenever a
    compiler is reachable (`ROKCT_TSC=<path to tsc>`, else `tsc` on
    PATH) and skipped otherwise.

## 1.20.0

* The host switch: the kernel answers WHICH TENANT a request host belongs
  to, so one deployment can open a tenant's portal on that tenant's own
  domain and keep the storefront on every other host. A tenant that points
  a `custom_domain` (on its Company Subscription at the control site) at
  the shell expects that host to be its login, not the platform's landing
  page; the control site owns that mapping, and since control #164 exposes
  it as the guest method
  `control.control.api.subscription.resolve_site_by_host(host)` ->
  `{"site_name": "<site>"}` or `null` (live subscriptions only; invalid,
  local and preview hosts answer `null` without a lookup).
  * `app/services/base/tenant-host-control.ts` (new): `resolveTenantSiteByHost(host)`
    asks that method with a plain guest `POST` to
    `ROKCT_BASE_URL/api/v1/method/<dotted name>` - no credentials ever, and
    not through the gateway door, which on a control site routes only
    registered `control:` keys and has none for this lookup - and answers
    the site name or `null`. Answers are cached in memory, positive for
    `TENANT_HOST_POSITIVE_TTL_MS` (5 min) and negative for
    `TENANT_HOST_NEGATIVE_TTL_MS` (60 s), overridable through
    `ROKCT_TENANT_HOST_TTL_MS` / `ROKCT_TENANT_HOST_NEGATIVE_TTL_MS`;
    one lookup is bounded by `ROKCT_TENANT_HOST_TIMEOUT_MS` (3 s) and
    concurrent lookups of one host share one request. It NEVER throws: a
    network error, a timeout, a non-2xx status or a malformed answer is
    `null` - unknown host = storefront - logged once per process. It never
    asks for a host that is not a public one (1.19.0's `isPublicHost`:
    localhost, loopback, `.vercel.app`, `.local`, `.internal`), for the
    configured `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` host or for the control host, and a
    host in the `ROKCT_TENANT_HOSTS` map answers from the map so a local
    run can point `localhost:3000` at a tenant. An answer that is not a
    host name, or that is the control site itself, is `null`: no host ever
    opens a portal against the control plane. `ROKCT_TENANT_HOST_LOOKUP=off`
    switches the lookup off.
  * `resolveTenantSiteForRequest(headers)` is the middleware entry:
    `x-forwarded-host` (first value) else `host`, port and a leading
    `www.` stripped, lower-cased - 1.19.0's `requestHost` - then the
    lookup above. The module imports only the pure kernel helpers and
    uses the global `fetch`, so it runs in the edge runtime as well as on
    the server. auth_sdk 1.7.0's middleware forwards its answer as the
    `x-rokct-tenant-site` request header (`TENANT_SITE_HEADER`).
  * `platform-gateway.ts` calls `registerControlTenantHostResolver()` at
    load, which plugs the same lookup into `setTenantHostResolver`
    (idempotent; a no-op without `ROKCT_BASE_URL` or with the lookup off;
    a host's own `setTenantHostResolver` call still replaces it), so
    `resolveTenantBaseUrl`'s per-host step now resolves a custom domain to
    its backend with no host wiring. Note that with a control site
    configured `hasTenantHostLookup()` is therefore true, so a call with
    no explicit `baseUrl` and no session site reads the request host.
  * The host predicate moved INTO the kernel so middleware can share it
    without pulling the metadata shell (and its `node:fs` probe) into the
    edge bundle: `tenant-hosts.ts` now carries `NON_PUBLIC_HOSTS`,
    `NON_PUBLIC_HOST_SUFFIXES`, `HeaderReader`, `normaliseHost()`,
    `isPublicHost()` and `requestHost()`; `app/lib/site-metadata.ts`
    imports and re-exports them, so its 1.19.0 surface and
    `resolveDisplayHost` are unchanged. `gateway-constants.ts` gains
    `PLATFORM_METHOD_PATH` (`/api/v1/method`), from which
    `PLATFORM_GATEWAY_PATH` is now derived.
  * `tests/tenant-host-control.test.mts` (new, node's own test runner,
    run by `tests/test_manifest.py`): the non-public, own-host, map and
    switched-off short-circuits make no call; a public host is asked once
    as a guest and cached; a negative answer is cached and asked again
    after its TTL, a positive one after its; concurrent lookups share a
    request; a network error, a non-2xx and a malformed answer are `null`,
    logged once; header precedence; and the registered resolver makes
    `lookupTenantHost` answer the tenant's origin.
* A PAGE's Metadata carries no `icons`; the layout is the favicon's single
  owner. Ray, 2026-09-09: "rokct got a letter favicon and lost its own
  image". `app/landing/page.tsx` is `force-dynamic` and its
  `generateMetadata` calls `buildPageMetadata()`, which resolved icons like
  the layout does; at request time in a serverless function
  `hostIconExists()` is false (see below) and with no registered
  `copy.icon` the page emitted the generated `/brand-icon` set. Next
  replaces `icons` per segment wholesale and suppresses the file-convention
  `app/icon.*` when any segment sets it, so the page's generated set
  overrode the root layout's explicit `icons` override - rokct.ai's own
  logo. `buildSiteMetadata()` now resolves icons ONLY for the layout scope:
  `buildPageMetadata()` emits no `icons` key and a page inherits the
  layout's answer (override, host file, `copy.icon`, generated - the same
  order as before); an explicit `icons` override is still returned
  untouched, without the disk check. supacharge-web is unaffected (no
  override, no icon file: the letter both before and after).
  * Known limitation, not fixed here: `hostIconExists()` is a runtime
    check of the process's working directory, and inside a Vercel function
    (cwd `/var/task`, `app/icon.*` not traced into the bundle) it is false
    even when the icon file is committed. A shell that relies on a
    file-convention icon WITHOUT a layout `icons` override may therefore
    still get the letter tile in production. Two candidate fixes, to be
    decided: a compose-time constant the installer writes (the composer
    knows at build time whether the host ships an icon file), or
    `outputFileTracingIncludes` in the shell's `next.config` so the icon
    files are traced and the disk check sees them.
  * `tests/site-metadata-icons.test.mts` (new; run by `test_manifest.py`
    against a staged copy with the registry stubbed): `buildPageMetadata()`
    has no `icons` key, `buildSiteMetadata()` (layout) has one, and
    `buildSiteMetadata({ icons })` returns the override untouched.
* The header's action buttons may carry a glyph. Ray, 2026-09-09: rokct
  "got its header back but it think it lost its chrome icon" - the old
  rokct header drew the Chrome mark on its "Add ROK Extension" button, and
  1.18.0's `HeaderMenuAction` was label only. `HeaderMenuAction` gains
  `icon?: HeaderMenuIcon`, `HeaderMenuActions` draws it before the label in
  both layouts (bar and stacked, `h-5 w-5`, the size the panel's cards draw
  theirs at), and `HeaderMenuIcon` gains `"chrome"`, mapped to
  lucide-react's own `Chrome` glyph - no third-party asset. An action
  without an icon renders exactly as before. agent_sdk sets
  `icon: "chrome"` on its extension action in a later release.

## 1.19.1

* Favicon letter colour found in any `:root` block. `app/brand-icon/route.tsx`
  (1.17.0) read the host's `--primary` from the FIRST `:root {` of
  `app/globals.css` and stopped at its first `}`. rokctai_frontend's
  stylesheet opens with a `:root` of `--foreground-rgb` and friends and
  keeps `--primary: 48 96% 53%` in a second `:root` under `@layer base`,
  so its tile drew a white R; supacharge-web, whose first `:root` already
  carries `--primary`, was orange. Ray, 2026-09-09: the letter takes the
  primary colour.
  * `rootBlocksOf(css)` (new) lists every `:root` block in source order,
    nested ones under `@layer` / `@media` included, each with its selector
    head and its BALANCED `{...}` body (comments stripped first so a brace
    in one cannot unbalance the scan). `rootPrimaryOf(css)` walks them and
    answers the first block that declares `--primary`, skipping a block
    whose selector also names `.dark` (`:root.dark`, `.dark :root`); a
    plain `.dark { ... }` block is never a match. The value parsing
    (shadcn `H S% L%`, hex, `rgb()`, `hsl()`, `oklch()`) and the fallback
    order - the registered `themeColor`, else `--primary`, else white -
    are unchanged, so a shell that resolved before resolves the same.
  * `tests/test_manifest.py` lifts the pure helpers out of the route and
    executes them under node (22.6+, type-stripping) against the two
    shells' layouts, a `.dark` `:root` override, a comment holding a
    brace and a file with `--primary-foreground` only.

## 1.19.0

* The host the shell SHOWS follows the REQUEST first. The generated
  favicon's letter (1.17.0) and the host line on the generated
  link-preview card (1.15.0) were both derived from the configured site
  url, so a white-label or custom domain in front of the same deployment
  showed the platform's letter and host rather than its own. Now both
  come from one helper, `resolveDisplayHost(copy, headers)` in
  `app/lib/site-metadata.ts`, and the request wins when it is a public
  host.
  * The rule: the request host - `x-forwarded-host` (its first value
    when a proxy chain appended) else `host`, the port dropped, a
    leading `www.` removed, lower-cased - UNLESS it is a non-public
    host, in which case the configured site's host (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`,
    else the copy's `url`), then the site name (or title). Non-public
    means: empty; exactly `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`, `::1` or
    `0.0.0.0`; or ending in `.vercel.app`, `.local` or `.internal`
    (`NON_PUBLIC_HOSTS`, `NON_PUBLIC_HOST_SUFFIXES`). So a custom
    domain gets its own letter and host line, and a preview deployment
    or a local run keeps the configured site's. Also exported:
    `normaliseHost()`, `isPublicHost()`, `requestHost()`, `siteHost()`,
    and the `HeaderReader` type (anything with `get`, so a request's
    `Headers` and next/headers' `headers()` both fit).
  * `app/brand-icon/route.tsx`: the letter is
    `resolveDisplayHost(copy, request.headers)`'s first letter or digit,
    else the site name's, else `R` - the same remaining fallbacks as
    1.17.0. Colour, size, ring and caching are unchanged; the route's own
    `hostOf` and `requestOrigin` helpers are gone with the old order.
  * `app/opengraph-image.tsx` (and so `app/twitter-image.tsx`): the
    card's host line is `resolveDisplayHost(copy, headers)` with the same
    `headers()` the route already read for the request origin, so nothing
    that was static becomes dynamic. Assets are still fetched from the
    request origin first and from the configured site url only when
    there is no request. `www.` is now stripped from the printed host.
  * `tests/test_manifest.py` checks the helper exists, reads
    `x-forwarded-host` then `host`, checks the request before the
    configured site, lists every excluded host and suffix, and that
    both routes call it.

## 1.18.0

* The header's `groups` open as ONE panel again - the mega menu. Ray,
  2026-09-09: "no mega menu anymore" on rokct.ai is a regression; rokct
  keeps everything its old header had, and Supacharge inherits the same
  header. 1.14.0 to 1.16.0 rendered each group as its own dropdown, so the
  five columns agent_sdk 1.8.0 registered from rokctai_frontend's
  `PLATFORM_FEATURES` became five `12rem` single-column menus on the bar.
  * `components/custom/header-menu.tsx`: `HeaderMenuNav` renders the groups
    as a single `DesktopMegaMenu` - one trigger, the FIRST group's label
    (with its badge), that discloses a panel `absolute inset-x-0 top-full`
    under the bar (the bar's backdrop-filter is its containing block, so it
    spans the bar's width and needs no knowledge of its height): inside, a
    `mx-auto max-w-6xl px-4 py-8` row with the first group's items as a
    300px lead column without a repeated heading, and every other group as a
    headed column (`h4`, 15px semibold) in a `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(9rem,
    1fr))` grid beside it - the geometry of rokctai_frontend's hand-written
    panel (`w-[300px]` cards left, four columns right). Same open/close
    contract as the 1.14.0 dropdown: hover, focus and click open; Escape
    (focus back on the button), an outside click, focus leaving it and a
    click on any of its links close. Theme tokens only: `bg-background`,
    `border-border`, `shadow-2xl`, `text-foreground`,
    `text-muted-foreground`, `hover:bg-foreground/5`, and `MenuLabel` for
    the new/soon pills. The trigger leads the row, ahead of the flat links,
    as the old bar's Product did (Product | Pricing | Affiliate | Teams);
    with no groups the row is the flat links alone, as before. The
    per-group `DesktopGroup` is gone.
  * `components/custom/landing/header-menu.ts`: `HeaderMenuLink` gains
    `description?: string` (one line under the label) and `icon?:
    HeaderMenuIcon`; `HeaderMenuIcon` is the closed set `"box" | "globe" |
    "smartphone" | "message-square" | "zap" | "wrench" | "file-text"`,
    resolved from lucide-react by name in header-menu.tsx (`MENU_ICONS`) so
    the header bundles seven glyphs rather than the library. Both fields
    are carried onto `HeaderMenuItem` by `resolveHeaderMenuItems` and
    `resolveHeaderMenu` (an anchor has neither), and an item with either
    renders as a card in the panel - icon box, label with badge, blurb,
    an arrow on hover - the way rokct.ai's Browser Extension / Web App /
    Mobile Apps tiles did; an item with neither is a 13.5px link. A "soon"
    card is non-navigable like a "soon" link.
  * Unchanged, so nothing composed today moves: the mobile panel
    (`HeaderMenuList`, each group a headed section of stacked links), the
    flat links, the actions, and the header's own markup. A menu with NO
    groups renders byte-for-byte as in 1.16.0 (Supacharge's header until
    lms_sdk registers groups). agent_sdk 1.9.0 fills the descriptions and
    icons for rokct.ai.
  * Not carried over from the old rokctai_frontend header: the Chrome Web
    Store glyph inside the "Add ROK Extension" button (an external CDN
    image; `HeaderMenuAction` has no icon field), the 200ms fade/slide of
    the panel (it toggles with the `hidden` attribute like the 1.14.0
    dropdown), and the 1.5s logo collapse with the nav fading until hover
    or scroll, which 1.14.0 already dropped.

## 1.17.0

* A FALLBACK favicon for a shell that has none. Ray, 2026-09-09: "on
  builds that dont have favicon like supacharge you can make it to take
  first letter of domain", and "that letter should take color of primary
  color". Additive, and a true fallback: nothing here replaces an icon a
  host already has.
  * `app/brand-icon/route.tsx` (new, installed) answers
    `GET /brand-icon?s=<px>` with a PNG app tile drawn by `next/og`: `s`
    square, 16..512, default 64; the card's `#0b0b0b` ground with the
    same top-right highlight, corners rounded 22%; the letter centred at
    about 62% of the square's height in the sans face next/og bundles
    (regular is the only weight it ships, so `fontWeight: 700` is
    honoured only where a bolder face is available). The letter is the
    first character of the site host - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, else the
    copy's `url`, else the origin of the request - with a leading `www.`
    stripped and uppercased; when the host gives no letter or digit the
    site name's first character is used, and failing that `R`. The
    letter is drawn in the shell's PRIMARY colour, never a hard-coded
    brand: the registered `themeColor`, else the first `--primary:`
    declaration inside the `:root` block of the host's `app/globals.css`
    (read from disk once per process; the shadcn `H S% L%` triple, hex,
    `rgb()`/`rgba()`, `hsl()`/`hsla()` and `oklch()` are understood and
    normalised to hex for satori), else `#ffffff`. A primary with a
    relative luminance under 0.18 keeps the letter and adds a ring of
    the same primary at 40% alpha (2px at 64, scaling with the tile) so
    it still reads on the dark ground. `Cache-Control: public,
    max-age=86400`. `runtime = "nodejs"`, like the og routes.
  * `buildSiteMetadata()` in `app/lib/site-metadata.ts` now builds
    `icons`, in this order: an `icons` override wins outright and the
    disk is not looked at; a host that ships an icon file Next serves by
    file convention - `app/favicon.ico`, `app/icon.png|svg|ico`,
    `app/apple-icon.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, checked with
    `fs.existsSync` under `process.cwd()` at call time, server-side only
    (`typeof window === "undefined"`, dynamic `node:fs` import, any
    failure counts as absent) - gets NO `icons` key, so that file stays
    the icon; a registered `copy.icon` is linked next (as the Apple touch
    icon too when it is a raster); and with none of those the links are
    `/brand-icon?s=64` (64x64) and `/brand-icon?s=192` (192x192) as
    `icon` and `/brand-icon?s=180` as `apple`. Exported helpers:
    `GENERATED_BRAND_ICON`, `HOST_ICON_FILES`, `hostIconExists()`,
    `generatedIcons()`, `registeredIcons(icon)`, `resolveIcons(copy)`.
  * `SiteMetadataCopy` in `components/custom/landing/site-metadata.ts`
    gains `icon?: string` - a public path or absolute URL to a `.png`,
    `.svg` or `.ico` - so a home SDK can ship a real icon later and
    register it with the same one line as the rest of its copy, replacing
    the generated tile without touching the host; and `themeColor?:
    string` - any CSS colour - for a letter colour other than the
    theme's `--primary`.
  * `tests/test_manifest.py` checks the route is in `installs` and
    references `themeColor` and `--primary`, that the registry declares
    `icon` and `themeColor`, and that `app/lib/site-metadata.ts`
    references `/brand-icon` and reads `copy.icon`.

## 1.16.0

* The generated link-preview card can show a STILL of the app. Ray,
  2026-09-09: the 1200x630 preview should show a still from the app's
  guided tour rather than only the wordmark. Additive: a shell whose
  registered copy names no still draws the single-column card of 1.15.0
  from exactly the same markup.
  * `SiteMetadataCopy` in `components/custom/landing/site-metadata.ts`
    gains `still?: string` - a public path or absolute URL to a PORTRAIT
    `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg` or `.webp` (a 1080x1920 tour screenshot is the
    expected shape) - and `stillAnchor?: "top" | "bottom"`, default
    `"bottom"`. Same extension rule as `ogImage`, same merge and load
    rules as every other field.
  * `app/opengraph-image.tsx` draws the two-column card when a still is
    registered: `#0b0b0b` ground with the top-right radial highlight as
    before; the left 45% (540px) a column with the registered logo at 64px
    - or the site name when there is no logo - the tagline at 38px in 72%
    white, and the host small at the bottom-left at 24px in 45% white; the
    right 55% the still drawn 372px wide at its own aspect inside a phone
    frame (`#1a1c1f`, 44px corners, 10px bezel, 34px inner corners, a
    `0 30px 80px rgba(0,0,0,0.6)` shadow) centred in the column and
    clipped by it. With `stillAnchor: "bottom"` the frame's top sits 72px
    under the card's top edge and the phone bleeds off the bottom, so the
    screen's header is what shows; with `"top"` the phone hangs from the
    top edge - top bezel cut, its bottom 72px above the card's bottom edge
    - for a screen that is a bottom sheet. The still is fetched by the same
    origin-first rule as the logo and inlined as a data URI; its size is
    read from its own header, which now covers JPEG (SOF) and WebP
    (VP8/VP8L/VP8X) alongside PNG (IHDR) and SVG. Best-effort as before: a
    still that will not load, or whose header gives no size, leaves the
    single-column card; a ready-made `ogImage` still wins outright.
  * `tests/test_manifest.py` checks that the registry declares `still` and
    `stillAnchor` and that the route reads `copy.still`.

## 1.15.0

* Ships the LINK-PREVIEW shell: what a pasted link to a rokct shell unfurls
  into - the `<title>`, the meta description, the Open Graph and Twitter
  cards and a 1200x630 preview image. Ray, 2026-09-09: each home SDK
  provides its link-preview details, the shell lives in base_sdk. The
  audit that prompted it: `app/layout.tsx` is host-owned and in no SDK's
  `installs` or `requires`, which is exactly how the two live shells drifted
  - one unfurls with copy hand-written into its layout and `app/site.ts`
  that describes a product it is not, the other with a starter template's
  leftovers (`metadataBase` pointing at the template author's domain, the
  template's description, and a template card as its only preview image).
  Neither had a real 1200x630 image of its own.
  * `components/custom/landing/site-metadata.ts` is a seventh one-marker
    registry, `// @rokct-sdk-site-metadata-start`, alongside
    `hero-sections.ts`, `hero-copy.ts`, `hero-form.ts`, `plans-query.ts`,
    `page-sections.ts` and `header-menu.ts`. A home SDK registers one line,
    `{ id: "<sdk>-site-metadata", load: () => import("@/components/custom/landing/<file>") },`
    whose module default-exports a `SiteMetadataCopy` or any subset of
    one: `title`, `description`, `tagline`, and optional `siteName`, `url`,
    `keywords`, `ogImage`, `logo`, `locale`. `loadSiteMetadata()` merges the
    entries in registry order (later wins per field, an `undefined` field
    keeps the earlier value) over `{ title: PLATFORM_NAME, siteName:
    PLATFORM_NAME, description: "", tagline: "" }`, and a module that fails
    to load is logged and skipped, exactly as `loadHeroCopy()` does.
  * `ogImage` and `logo` are two fields on purpose. `ogImage` is a
    READY-MADE preview and counts only when it ends in `.png`, `.jpg`,
    `.jpeg` or `.webp`; an SVG mark is not a preview image because the
    crawlers that unfurl a link do not draw it. `logo` is that mark, and it
    is what the generated image draws - so a home SDK with only a logo
    still gets a proper card, and one with a designed 1200x630 asset gets
    its own.
  * `app/lib/site-metadata.ts` is the shell: `buildSiteMetadata(overrides?)`
    loads the copy and returns the Next `Metadata` - `metadataBase` from
    `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` or the copy's `url` (absent, Next falls back to
    `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL`), `title: { default, template: "%s — <siteName>" }`,
    `description`, `applicationName`, `keywords`, `alternates.canonical`,
    an Open Graph `website` block (`siteName`, `locale` defaulting to
    `en_ZA`, the preview at 1200x630) and a `summary_large_image` Twitter
    card. `overrides` are shallow-merged last, so the host keeps `icons`
    and anything else that is its own.
  * `app/opengraph-image.tsx` is the generated preview, drawn with the
    `ImageResponse` that ships in `next/og` from the same copy: the
    registered `logo` fetched from the site origin and inlined as a data
    URI (SVG allowed), the site name large, the tagline under it, the host
    small at the foot, on a dark neutral ground, in the bundled sans face -
    no font fetch, no filesystem read. `app/twitter-image.tsx` is the same
    picture. Next gives a file at this path priority over any config-based
    image, so the route also HONOURS a ready-made `ogImage`: when one is a
    real raster it fetches it and answers with those bytes instead of
    drawing. Every fetch is best-effort - a logo that will not load leaves
    a text-only card, never an error.
  * `app/landing/page.tsx` exports `generateMetadata()` from
    `buildPageMetadata()` - the same Metadata with the title absolute, so a
    layout that already applies the `%s — <siteName>` template does not
    suffix it twice - and the page anonymous visitors are redirected to
    unfurls right on its own, before the host layout is touched. Nothing
    else on the page changes.
  * Two host steps, because `app/layout.tsx` is the host's and no SDK may
    ship it (it is now a `requires` entry, with the reason in the manifest):
    the layout replaces its literal `metadata` with the one-liner
    `export const generateMetadata = () => buildSiteMetadata({ icons: {...} })`
    (from `@/app/lib/site-metadata`, host-only keys as overrides); and
    Supacharge neutralises `SITE_DESCRIPTION` in `app/site.ts` (and the
    layout copy that reads it) so the words its home SDK registers are the
    only words the shell speaks. With NOTHING registered a shell is named
    after `PLATFORM_NAME` and unfurls with a card that says so and no
    description - honest rather than wrong - so a shell composed before its
    home SDK registers is no worse off than it was.

## 1.14.0

* SHIPS the header. Ray, 2026-09-09, on the two live shells: rokct.ai and
  supacharge.app must use ONE header - the same component - with the menu
  INSIDE it, links inline on desktop, and on a phone nothing in the bar but
  a burger. `components/custom/header.tsx` is therefore an `installs` entry
  now (`templates/components/custom/header.tsx`), no longer a `requires`
  file the host shell had to write itself, and the composer lands it on
  every shell. Its public API is the one both shells' own headers had -
  `loginUrl`, `signupUrl`, `session`, and the `openLoginPopup` /
  `openSignupPopup` handlers auth_sdk's login and register pages pass - so
  the pages that already render `<Header>` compile unchanged; the menu
  props (`menuItems`, `groups`, `actions`, `nav`) are new and all optional.
  * A caller that passes none of `menuItems`/`groups`/`actions` gets the
    registered menu loaded by the header itself (`loadHeaderMenu()`,
    resolved with `resolveHeaderMenu(menu, nav ?? [])`), because rokct.ai
    mounts the header on /login, /register, /careers and /status without
    the landing host: the fixed links, the groups and the actions render on
    every such page, and an anchor only where a `nav` with its section was
    given. The landing host passes the menu it resolved against its live
    nav; props win when present.
  * An entry with `badge: "soon"` is not out yet, so it is not a link: it
    renders as a span with `aria-disabled` and the not-allowed cursor,
    label and `MenuLabel` intact, in the inline nav, the dropdowns and the
    mobile panel alike (rokct.ai's own header treats a coming-soon feature
    the same way). An action with `external: true` opens in a new tab with
    `rel="noreferrer"`.
  * From the `lg` breakpoint up the bar is logo, then
    `nav[aria-label="Sections"]` with the flat links and the dropdown
    groups (open on hover, focus and click; Escape and an outside click
    close them), then the actions, the theme toggle and the auth links
    (Dashboard when signed in, else Log in and the Sign up pill).
  * Below `lg` the bar is logo and a burger (`aria-expanded`,
    `aria-controls`), nothing else: every link, each group as a headed
    list, the actions, the theme toggle and the auth buttons sit in a
    full-screen panel under the bar. The panel closes on a tap on any of
    its links, on Escape, on a route change and on the burger; the page
    behind it does not scroll while it is open. A header with no menu
    still shows the burger, because the auth links are behind it.
  * The chrome is rokctai_frontend's (64px bar, blurred translucent
    ground, bottom hairline) painted in the shell's theme tokens -
    `bg-background/80`, `border-border`, `text-foreground`, `bg-primary` -
    so rokct.ai renders it in its palette and Supacharge in its own. The
    host still owns the brand mark, the wordmark and the theme control:
    `brand-logo.tsx`, `branding.tsx` and `theme-toggle.tsx` stay
    `requires` files (the last is newly listed; both shells carry it at
    that path with the same `className` prop).
  * It is `sticky`, not `fixed`, so no page under it needs a top padding
    and the hero's own `pt-16` is unchanged from 1.13.0.
* `HeaderMenu` (`components/custom/landing/header-menu.ts`) may now name
  `groups` and `actions` beside `anchors` and `links`, which are exactly as
  they were - lms_sdk's registration keeps working untouched.
  * A `HeaderMenuGroup` is `{ id, label, badge?, items }`, a label that
    opens a dropdown; each item is a fixed `HeaderMenuLink` or
    `{ anchor: "<section id>" }`, resolved against the live nav by the
    same drop-missing rule as a top-level anchor. A group whose every item
    was dropped is dropped with them, so a label never opens an empty list.
  * A `HeaderMenuAction` is `{ id, label, href, variant?: "primary" |
    "ghost", external? }`, a call-to-action button at the right-hand end
    of the bar (rokct.ai's Chrome-extension button is the model).
  * `resolveHeaderMenu(menu, nav)` answers `{ items, groups, actions }`;
    `resolveHeaderMenuItems` is still exported and unchanged. The marker
    line is the same text. `HeaderMenuLink` carries an optional `id`, the
    React key when present (the href stands in when absent).
* ONE menu label. Every badge beside a menu word - the NEW on Supacharge's
  Partners, a SOON - is `components/custom/menu-label.tsx` (`MenuLabel`,
  `{ badge, className? }`): a `bg-primary` pill with `text-black` (Ray:
  "use primary color and text in black" - not `text-primary-foreground`,
  which a shell may set to white), the word uppercased by CSS from the
  declared `"new"`/`"soon"` vocabulary. The header uses it in all three
  places (inline nav, dropdown groups, mobile panel) and it is the label
  for any footer link row a home SDK builds from the same nav entries. The
  only badge base_sdk painted before this was `header-menu.tsx`'s neutral
  black/white `HeaderMenuBadge`; it is gone.
* `components/custom/header-menu.tsx` is the header's menu partials now:
  `HeaderMenuNav` (the inline desktop list), `HeaderMenuList` (the stacked
  mobile list) and `HeaderMenuActions`. `HeaderMenuRow`, the 1.13.0 bar
  that sat UNDER the host's header, is kept as a thin wrapper around
  `HeaderMenuNav` so an existing import still compiles, but the landing
  host NO LONGER RENDERS IT: `components/custom/landing-content.tsx`
  passes the resolved menu straight into `<Header>` and the sticky wrapper
  with the row under the header is gone - one element tree whether or not
  a menu is registered.
* Carries the platform marquee, additive only (Ray, 2026-09-09: Supacharge
  is to inherit rokct.ai's auto-scrolling testimonials).
  * `app/styles/rokct-marquee.css`: the `.rokct-marquee` keyframes (60s
    linear infinite, `translateX(0)` to `translateX(-33.333%)`, the
    duration in `--rokct-marquee-duration`), paused under `.group:hover`,
    and off under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` with the
    `.rokct-marquee-track` left scrollable by hand. Until now that motion
    existed only as `animate-marquee` in rokctai_frontend's own
    `tailwind.config.ts`; no SDK ships a Tailwind config, so no other shell
    could run it. Installed and importable exactly like `rokct-scroll.css`.
  * `components/custom/landing/testimonials-marquee.tsx`:
    `TestimonialsMarquee({ items, className?, fadeClassName?,
    cardClassName? })`, agent_sdk's testimonials row element for element
    (tripled list, `.group` wrapper, two edge fades, `w-max` track, 350px
    cards with title, four-line quote, 40px portrait or initial, author and
    role) with its class strings as the defaults, so with no overrides it
    is DOM-identical to rokct.ai's row apart from `animate-marquee`
    becoming `rokct-marquee`. It imports the stylesheet itself, so a
    section that renders it needs no host edit. No consumer in base; a home
    SDK's own testimonials section renders it.

* Hero: a rotating headline phrase that wraps to two lines on a phone no
  longer pushes the suffix down onto the primary button. The phrase sits in
  a fixed `h-[1.2em]` box (`components/custom/hero.tsx`) that `items-center`
  let overflow both ways, so the second line landed on the suffix; the box
  is `items-end md:items-center` now, so below `md` the wrap grows upward
  into the gap under the brand block and the suffix stays put. Desktop is
  unchanged.
* Hero: the rotating headline word is `text-primary`, not `text-yellow-400`
  (Ray: the brand colour lives in the primary token, never hard-coded), so
  each shell's word is its own primary. rokct.ai's `--primary` must be its
  yellow for the word to stay yellow there; `rokct-scroll.css` is already
  variable-driven and is untouched.

## 1.13.0

* Adds a HEADER MENU seam, and with it the half of Ray's report that nothing
  had answered. Looking at the live site he said "menus in header and footer
  are not injected". The FOOTER half a home SDK could always answer by
  itself, because its own footer section owns that markup - lms_sdk's
  `lms-footer-section.tsx` has rendered its link row since it shipped. The
  HEADER half it could not: `components/custom/header.tsx` is a `requires`
  file, the host shell's own, so no SDK may ship it and a home SDK had
  nowhere to put a header link. The landing host is the one thing that
  renders that header, so the seam belongs here.
  * `components/custom/landing/header-menu.ts` is a sixth one-marker
    registry, `// @rokct-sdk-header-menu-start`, alongside
    `hero-sections.ts`, `hero-copy.ts`, `hero-form.ts`, `plans-query.ts` and
    `page-sections.ts`. A home SDK registers one line,
    `{ id: "<sdk>-header-menu", load: () => import("@/components/custom/landing/<file>") }`,
    and `loadHeaderMenu()` answers the FIRST entry that loads - one page, one
    header menu, exactly as `hero-form.ts` picks one form.
  * A `HeaderMenu` names `anchors` - SECTION IDS, not hrefs - and optional
    fixed `links`. `resolveHeaderMenuItems()` resolves the anchors against
    the nav the host has ALREADY computed for this render, the list that has
    been through every section's `meta.renders` predicate. So the label and
    the badge come from the `meta.nav` entry the home SDK already owns and
    are never restated in a second place, and an anchor whose section did not
    render is DROPPED rather than linked to nothing. That last part is the
    point: a hand-written list of hrefs would have reintroduced exactly the
    dead-tick problem `PageSectionMeta.renders` was added in 1.11.0 to stop.
  * `components/custom/header-menu.tsx` is the row, `HeaderMenuRow`, generic
    chrome in the `footer-chrome.tsx` mould: neutral black/white alphas and
    `currentColor` only, so it takes the ground and the ink of whatever
    header it sits under in both themes, and the badge is stated in the
    declared `"new"`/`"soon"` vocabulary without claiming a palette - the
    same split the nav badge got, where base_sdk declared the words and each
    nav rendered them in its own tokens. An empty list renders nothing, so a
    host can mount it without deciding anything.
  * With a menu, `components/custom/landing-content.tsx` pins the host header
    and the row together inside one sticky wrapper, so the row needs no
    knowledge of the host header's height and the host header's own
    `sticky top-0` is harmless inside an already-pinned parent.
  * With NOTHING registered `loadHeaderMenu()` answers `null`, the row
    renders nothing and the host emits the bare `<Header>` element tree it
    always did. rokctai_frontend, whose header carries its own mega menu out
    of `app/config/features.ts`, is untouched - no SDK supplies its menu and
    none of its files change.

## 1.12.0

* Adds the COPYRIGHT ROW every rokct shell ends its page with as shared
  chrome, so each shell renders it instead of keeping a copy. rokct.ai has
  carried this row for a while - the copyright line on the left, a status
  pill and the version string on the right - but only as host-owned code in
  rokctai_frontend's `components/custom/footer.tsx`, which no other shell can
  reach. Ray asked for Supacharge to carry the same row; a second copy in
  lms_sdk would have made it a third copy of generic chrome, so it moves
  here, the way the scrollbar treatment did.
  * `components/custom/footer-chrome.tsx` is the row: `FooterChromeRow`,
    laid out exactly as rokct.ai's is (`© Copyright <year> - <holder>`, then
    the pill, then `Version <v>` from `md` up). It is shell-agnostic by
    construction - no product name, no company, no brand hue. The only
    colours the markup names are neutral `black/5`/`white/5` alphas, which
    sit on whatever ground the footer already has in either theme.
  * `components/custom/landing/footer-chrome-config.ts` holds the wire and
    the words. `FooterChromeConfig` carries the copyright holder, the
    copyright year, the version and label overrides; the generic default
    reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_COPYRIGHT_HOLDER` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION`, so a
    shell that sets those gets the row with no code. An absent holder hides
    the copyright line and an absent version hides the version string rather
    than either being invented.
  * `app/actions/base/status.ts` probes the status: `getPlatformStatus()`,
    one guest `platformCall` per probe through the single gateway, no
    credentials. It is a server action and the cmds are fixed here rather
    than passed in from the browser, because a client that could name the
    cmd would turn the action into a guest proxy for the whole gateway.
  * THE TENANT ANSWERS FIRST, control is the fallback. base_sdk's own tenant
    endpoint `api.system.api_status` is `allow_guest=True` (core
    `base/frappe/src/tenant/api/system/system.py`) and answers
    `{status: "ok" | "maintenance", version, user}`, so a tenant can speak
    for itself AND report its own maintenance window - the state a visitor to
    that tenant actually cares about. `control:get_versions` (also
    `allow_guest=True`, and what rokct.ai's footer reads today) answers when
    the tenant cannot be reached or the deployment has no tenant of its own.
    `ROKCT_STATUS_SOURCE` reorders or narrows that (`tenant`, `control`,
    `control,tenant`, `off`), so which site answers is a deployment setting,
    not a release.
  * Four states, not two. `operational` and `offline` are rokct.ai's pair;
    `maintenance` is added because the backend genuinely reports it rather
    than being invented; and `unconfigured` - nothing to ask, because no
    backend origin is set - hides the indicator instead of painting a red dot
    a shell has no evidence for. A probe that could not run is skipped
    without counting as a failure, so only a site that was asked and did not
    answer makes the row say offline.
  * The dot's three colours are the one thing treated as semantic rather
    than themed: green/amber/red reads without a legend, and an orange dot on
    an orange page says nothing. They are values, not literals in the markup
    (`FOOTER_CHROME_STATUS_COLORS`), so a shell whose palette carries
    semantic tokens hands those in instead - Supacharge passes
    `var(--sc-success)` / `var(--sc-star)` / `var(--sc-danger)`.
  * `ROKCT_CONTROL_BASE_URL` names the control plane for the control probe,
    falling back to `ROKCT_BASE_URL`. A dedicated name because
    `ROKCT_BASE_URL` means different things per shell: on rokctai_frontend it
    IS the control site, on a single-tenant shell it is that tenant.
  * Nothing existing changes. The landing host does not render the row yet
    and rokctai_frontend's host `footer.tsx` is untouched, so this release is
    additive for every current consumer; migrating rokct.ai onto the shared
    row is a follow-up that needs Ray's word before any host code is
    removed.

## 1.11.0

* A registered section can now say whether it BELONGS on the page, and the
  floating nav follows that answer. `PageSectionMeta` grows an optional
  `renders?: (ctx: PageSectionContext) => boolean`, where
  `PageSectionContext` is `{plans, session}` - the same page facts the
  section is handed in `PageSectionProps`, so the test that keeps a section
  off the page is the very test the page asks before listing it as a stop.
  * `components/custom/landing-content.tsx` asks it ONCE, in a `present`
    memo over the loaded sections, and everything downstream - the overlay
    list, the flow list and `navItems` - reads off that one list. That is
    the point: a section and its nav tick come from a single answer and
    cannot drift apart.
  * It exists because a section that hides itself had no honest way to be a
    nav stop. `meta.nav` is static and read at load, before the section
    renders, so a section whose visibility depends on fetched data had to
    choose between a permanent tick that sometimes scrolls nowhere and no
    tick at all. lms_sdk's pricing section chose the latter and carried
    `nav: []` with a comment explaining why; it can now carry a real
    Pricing entry that appears exactly when there are plans to show.
  * Absent predicate means the section always belongs, so this is additive:
    every section registered before 1.11.0 renders in the same place and
    contributes the same nav entries. rokctapp's landing is byte-identical.

## 1.10.0

* Gives a floating-nav entry somewhere to say it is NEW or coming SOON.
  rokct.ai has carried those little pills in its header menu for a long
  time; a landing page composed from the SDKs had no way to express one,
  because `LandingNavItem` was `{ id, label }` and that is the only thing a
  section can contribute to the nav.
  * `components/custom/landing/landing-config.ts` adds one OPTIONAL field,
    `badge?: "new" | "soon"` (the union is exported as `LandingNavBadge`).
    Purely additive: every `{ id, label }` entry a section already registers
    in `meta.nav` compiles and renders exactly as before.
  * No new registry and no new marker. The badge rides on the nav entry the
    section already owns, which follows the standing rule that base_sdk's
    floating nav derives its list from what the home SDK registered - there
    is no second list to keep in step, and a section that stops being new
    edits only its own `meta.nav`.
  * base_sdk defines the vocabulary, not the pixels. It ships no badge
    markup: the floating nav itself belongs to the home SDK (agent_sdk's
    `floating-nav.tsx`, lms_sdk's `lms-floating-nav.tsx`), and those two
    already diverge on purpose - rokctapp's ticks and tooltip are zinc,
    Supacharge's are `--sc-*` tokens. A shared badge would have to pick one
    palette for both, and rokct's accent is yellow where Supacharge's is
    orange, so each renderer paints the badge in its own theme token.

## 1.9.0

* Gives the landing host's PLANS QUERY the seam its sections, its hero copy
  and its hero form already have. The host prefetches one plan list and
  hands it to every registered section; which plans those are was fixed in
  `components/custom/landing/landing-config.ts` as the platform's
  `Subscription Plan` catalog - the plans on which someone RUNS a rokct app
  (the tenant fixtures price them USD 20 monthly / USD 200 yearly). That is
  exactly right for rokctai_frontend, whose visitors buy an LMS to run, and
  exactly wrong for a product whose landing page sells to its own end users:
  Supacharge's visitors are learners, and the plans they buy are that
  tenant's own catalog. A thin shell cannot fix that by editing the
  installed `landing-config.ts`, because the next compose regenerates it.
  * `components/custom/landing/plans-query.ts` is a fifth one-marker
    registry on the same contract as `page-sections.ts`, `hero-sections.ts`,
    `hero-copy.ts` and `hero-form.ts`: a home SDK contributes its query by
    injecting ONE line at `// @rokct-sdk-plans-query-start` through its
    manifest `integrations`,
    `{ id: "<sdk>-plans", load: () => import("@/components/custom/landing/<file>") }`,
    naming a module it installs whose default export is a
    `LandingPlansQuery` (`{cmd, payload}`) or `null`. A separate file for
    the same reason the others are: `update_integrations()` anchors
    successive entries per target file, so one file carries one marker and
    an entry is a single self-contained line with a dynamic import.
  * `loadLandingPlansQuery()` answers the FIRST entry that loads - one
    page, one plan list, exactly as `hero-form.ts` picks one form. An entry
    that throws is logged and skipped in favour of the next; a registered
    module whose default is `null` is a deliberate "prefetch no plans" and
    is honoured. With NOTHING registered the loop does not run and the
    answer is `LANDING_CONFIG.plansQuery` verbatim.
  * `app/actions/base/landing.ts` reads the query through that loader
    instead of `LANDING_CONFIG.plansQuery` directly. Nothing else about the
    fetch changes: still one guest `platformCall` through the single
    gateway, still `plan_category` mirrored onto `category`, still an empty
    list on any failure.
  * Engineering only for rokctapp: composed with nothing registered at the
    marker, `getLandingPlans()` sends the identical `frappe.client.get_list`
    of `Subscription Plan`, so rokctai_frontend's pricing shows the same
    tenant catalog it shows today. `landing-config.ts` keeps that query as
    the documented generic default.

## 1.8.0

* Carries the platform scrollbar. Ray, 2026-09-08: "rokctai_frontend has
  a unique scroll with yellow color i think each sdk should use it, so it
  can move to base sdk". `app/styles/rokct-scroll.css` is rokctai_frontend's
  "Custom Scrollbar" block (`app/globals.css` lines 165-189 on its main: a
  6px webkit scrollbar, transparent track, `#facc15` thumb, `#eab308` on
  hover, the same in `.dark`) with the values as CSS variables on `:root` -
  `--rokct-scroll-width`, `--rokct-scroll-track`, `--rokct-scroll-thumb`,
  `--rokct-scroll-thumb-hover` - the yellow as the default, so a home SDK
  rethemes the scroll by redefining them in a stylesheet of its own.
  `app/landing/page.tsx` imports the file, so a composed shell has the
  scroll on `/landing` with no host edit; a host that wants it on every
  route adds `@import "./styles/rokct-scroll.css";` to its
  `app/globals.css`. rokctai_frontend keeps its own identical rules in
  `globals.css` and renders the same.

## 1.7.0

* Takes the input out of the hero and gives the hero a form slot. Ray,
  2026-09-08: "no hero work same way as landing, they need to be injected
  like generic profile, chat box is for chat related stuff, i think if
  agent sdk is home it inject that chat". The search-style input, its
  typewriter placeholders, the submit and the results the hero-sections
  registry rendered under the input were rokctapp's chat box living in the
  generic hero; they belong to the home SDK that owns chat, so they moved
  to agent_sdk 1.5.0 (`components/custom/landing/agent-hero-form.tsx`),
  and the hero renders whatever the home SDK registers in their place.
  Engineering only: rokctapp composed with agent_sdk 1.5.0 renders the same
  DOM as before; a shell with nothing registered renders the headline,
  trust line and badges with no box.
  * `components/custom/landing/hero-form.ts` is a fourth one-marker registry
    on the same contract as `hero-sections.ts`, `hero-copy.ts` and
    `page-sections.ts`: a home SDK contributes its form by injecting ONE
    line at `// @rokct-sdk-hero-form-start` through its manifest
    `integrations`,
    `{ id: "<sdk>-<form>", load: () => import("@/components/custom/landing/<file>") }`,
    naming a client component module it installs whose default export
    takes `HeroFormProps`: `hero` (the resolved `HeroConfig`), `signupUrl`,
    and the optional `onFocusChange`, `onActiveChange` and
    `onHeadlineWordsChange` callbacks through which a form keeps the hero
    collapsing its wordmark while the box is in use, tells the page while
    results are showing and adds its sections' headline words to the
    rotation. `loadHeroForm()` resolves the FIRST registered entry (one
    hero, one form); an entry that fails to load is logged and skipped in
    favour of the next, and none leaves the slot empty.
  * `hero.tsx` renders that entry through a `next/dynamic` loader, so the
    form is server-rendered with the rest of the hero and the loader adds
    no wrapper node; with the registry empty there is no loader and the
    slot renders nothing, server and client alike, so the markup is
    deterministic either way. The brand, the rotating headline
    (`headlineWords` plus whatever the form reports), `headlineSuffix`,
    the background, the trust line and the badges are unchanged.
  * `hero-sections.ts` stays: feature SDKs keep registering sections into
    it (agent_sdk's `agent-opportunities`), but the registered form, not
    the hero, loads and renders them now. `hero-config.ts` keeps
    `placeholders`, `logoPlaceholderToken` and `fallbackHref` for the form
    to read.
  * Lands after agent_sdk 1.5.0: its integration against a base without
    `hero-form.ts` is a "target not found" line the installer skips, and
    its form file type-checks without the registry, so rokct.ai shows the
    unchanged 1.6.0 hero in between; the other order would show the hero
    with no box until agent_sdk followed.
## 1.6.0

* Gives the hero's copy a seam, so a shell's home SDK can supply the hero's
  words instead of every shell showing rokctapp's ("Everything is a chat
  away", "Trusted by 20M+ users", the store badges). A thin shell cannot
  edit `hero-config.ts` durably - installed files are regenerated on every
  compose - and the hero section registry only APPENDS headline words and
  placeholders (agent_sdk's `agent-opportunities` `meta`), it never replaces
  the default copy. Engineering only: the default stays rokctapp's copy,
  byte for byte, and a shell that registers nothing renders exactly as
  before.
  * `components/custom/landing/hero-copy.ts` is a third one-marker registry
    on the same contract as `hero-sections.ts` and `page-sections.ts`: a
    home SDK contributes its copy by injecting ONE line at
    `// @rokct-sdk-hero-copy-start` through its manifest `integrations`,
    `{ id: "<sdk>-hero", load: () => import("@/components/custom/landing/<file>") }`,
    naming a module it installs whose default export is a `HeroCopy` -
    `Partial<HeroConfig>`: `headlineWords`, `headlineSuffix`,
    `wordIntervalMs`, `placeholders`, `logoPlaceholderToken`,
    `backgroundImage`, `trustLine`, `badges`, `fallbackHref`, any subset.
    `loadHeroCopy()` loads the registered modules on the client and merges
    them in registry order (an absent field keeps the default, a later
    entry wins a repeated one; a module that fails to load is logged and
    skipped). A separate file for the reason the other two are: the
    installer anchors successive entries for a target file after the
    previous one whichever marker they named, so one file carries one
    marker.
  * `hero.tsx` starts on `HERO_CONFIG` when the registry is empty (the
    same first render as before, server and client) and otherwise on no
    copy at all - no headline, placeholders, background, trust line or
    badges - until the registered copy resolves, so a visitor to a shell
    whose home SDK supplies the copy never sees another product's words
    first. Every `HERO_CONFIG.` read in the component now goes through the
    resolved copy; the markup is unchanged.
  * `hero-config.ts` keeps rokctapp's words and is now documented as the
    default a home SDK overlays, not the file a thin shell edits.
  * Declares what the sidebar chrome already needed: `next-auth`
    (`5.0.0-beta.30`, the version rokctapp and supacharge pin) joins
    `dependencies`, and `components/custom/session-provider.tsx` joins
    `requires` - `app-sidebar.tsx` and `nav/team-switcher.tsx` read
    `useSession()` from `next-auth/react`, which only works under the
    provider that file mounts, so a shell composing base_sdk without
    auth_sdk (which installs it since auth_sdk 1.4.0, Users#93) must ship
    a pass-through or `/manager` 500s at runtime. `requires` is a warn-only
    check, so the composer's checklist now names the gap; rokctapp already
    has the file and the dependency, supacharge-web gets both in its #11.

## 1.5.0

* Carries the rest of the landing HOST as generic templates, on top of
  1.4.0's hero - and only the host. Ray, 2026-09-03: "each home sdk holds
  its own landing page", "similar to profile in dart": base_sdk holds the
  page, the orchestrator, the section registry and the generic hero; the
  content sections of a product's landing page live in that product's home
  SDK (agent_sdk 1.4.0 for rokctapp) and register themselves here. The
  host files land on the shell's own paths, so the composer overwrites the
  shell copies and they become SDK-owned copies to sweep:
  `app/landing/page.tsx` and `components/custom/landing-content.tsx`.
  * `components/custom/landing/page-sections.ts` is a second one-marker
    registry: a home SDK contributes a section by injecting ONE line at
    `// @rokct-sdk-page-sections-start` through its manifest
    `integrations`, `{ id: "<file>", load: () => import("@/components/custom/<file>") }`,
    exactly like the hero registry (a separate file because
    `update_integrations()` anchors entries per target file, so one file
    carries one marker). The module contract is `{ default, meta? }`:
    `meta.order` places the section (ascending, 100 when absent, registry
    order breaking ties; the hero is 0 and stays first; a negative order
    renders before the hero, outside the block the page hides while the
    hero shows search results - for a fixed overlay such as a floating
    nav), `meta.nav` adds its floating-nav entries (the first id is the
    section's DOM id; the page renders empty anchors for the rest; `[]`
    for no entry) and `meta.anchor` names the DOM id of a section with no
    nav entry. Each section receives `PageSectionProps`: id, signupUrl,
    loginUrl, session, the prefetched `plans` and the whole `nav` in page
    order.
  * `components/custom/landing-content.tsx` loads the registered modules
    on the client, sorts them by order and renders them around the hero;
    it names no section, so a shell with nothing registered renders the
    hero alone.
  * `components/custom/landing/landing-config.ts` holds the generic values
    only: the login/sign-up URLs, `planSignupUrl`, the nav's hero and
    footer ends and `plansQuery` (default: the Subscription Plan list). No
    product copy.
  * `app/landing/page.tsx` reads the session through the kernel seam
    (`getPlatformSession`, never `app/(auth)` directly) and prefetches the
    plans through the new `app/actions/base/landing.ts` (`getLandingPlans`,
    a guest `platformCall` of `LANDING_CONFIG.plansQuery`, `plan_category`
    mirrored onto `category`), handing them to every section. The shell's
    page imported `@/lib/actions/getSubscriptionPlans`, which does not
    exist in the shell, so its prefetch never compiled.
  * NOT carried here: the shell's floating-nav, logos, social, features,
    workflow, pricing, comparison, faq and testimonials sections and their
    copy - they are rokctapp's and move to agent_sdk 1.4.0, which registers
    them (with the chat section) in page order. The eight sections the
    shell kept but never rendered (`banner`, `category-selector`, `cta`,
    `devices-section`, `extension-section`, `features`, `security-section`,
    `teams-section`) are not carried either: nothing imports them.
  * `requires` adds the host's `components/custom/header.tsx` (the landing
    host renders the shell header, which the shell's status and careers
    pages also use).

## 1.4.0

* Carries the landing hero as a GENERIC template (Ray, 2026-09-03: "hero
  goes to base sdk as generic"): `components/custom/hero.tsx` renders the
  brand, a rotating headline, a search-style input and the store badges,
  and nothing of any product feature. It lands on the same path as the
  RokctAI_frontend shell's own copy, which the composer overwrites.
  * `components/custom/landing/hero-config.ts` holds every word on it
    (headline words and suffix, input placeholders, trust line, badges,
    background) plus `fallbackHref`, where a submit goes when no section
    is registered (default: the signup URL, so the input is a plain call
    to action). Badges read the host's `app/config/features.ts` toggles as
    the shell copy did; the hero component itself no longer does.
  * `components/custom/landing/hero-sections.ts` is the section registry:
    a feature SDK contributes what happens to a submitted query by
    injecting ONE line at `// @rokct-sdk-hero-sections-start` through its
    manifest `integrations` - the same contract as the nav marker in
    `app/handson/sidebar-client.tsx` and the flag marker in
    `app/config/compose.ts`. An entry is
    `{ id, load: () => import("@/components/custom/landing/<file>") }`;
    the hero loads registered modules on the client and renders each
    default export under the input with `HeroSectionProps` (the query, a
    submit counter, `onActiveChange` / `onBusyChange` / `onClear`). A
    module's optional `meta` export adds headline words and placeholders,
    so a feature's copy stays in the feature's file. The dynamic import is
    what keeps a contribution to one line: `update_integrations()` anchors
    successive entries for a target file after the previous entry
    regardless of which marker they named, so a file can carry one marker
    and an entry cannot bring its own import statement. agent_sdk's
    opportunities search is the first section (agent_sdk 1.3.0).
  * Icons come from `lucide-react` (already a dependency) rather than the
    shell copy's `react-icons`; `framer-motion` is added to
    `dependencies`. `requires` adds the host's `app/config/features.ts`,
    `components/custom/brand-logo.tsx` and `components/custom/branding.tsx`.

## 1.3.0

* `src/services/platform-gateway.ts` now carries the tenant/session
  wrapper the paas-era shell kept in `app/lib/paas-gateway.ts`, mirroring
  the Dart kernel where `PlatformGateway` sits on `HttpService`
  (baseUrl) + `TokenInterceptor` (the token auth_sdk writes) and feature
  SDKs call it directly (Ray, 2026-09-03):
  * `resolveTenantBaseUrl()` picks the backend PER CALL, never at build
    time, so one Next.js instance serves any number of tenants: an
    explicit `baseUrl` option, else the signed-in user's tenant site
    (`session.user.siteName`), else the request host mapped to a tenant
    site (`ROKCT_TENANT_HOSTS` JSON map or a resolver registered with
    `setTenantHostResolver`, the hook for a control-site lookup later),
    else `ROKCT_BASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROKCT_BASE_URL` /
    `NEXT_PUBLIC_FRAPPE_URL` (the paas-gateway name, kept as an alias).
    The request headers are only read when a host lookup is configured.
  * `platformCall()` sends the session's API credentials as
    `Authorization: token key:secret` unless the caller passes its own
    header or `requireAuth: false` (the Dart client's flag). Unlike the
    Dart app, which has one baseUrl, a call here may be steered at
    another site (an explicit `baseUrl` for the control plane), so the
    credentials only go to the session's own site (`siteName`, or any
    target when the session names none) — never to a different origin.
    It accepts `session` / `request` inputs for callers that hold them,
    and gains `throwOnError` (default `false`, so the existing
    `null`-on-failure contract is unchanged) which throws a
    `PlatformGatewayError` carrying `cmd`, `reason` and the HTTP
    `status`.
  * The "no session / no request scope" catch-alls let Next.js's own
    render signals through (`isNextRenderSignal`: dynamic-usage bailouts,
    prerender interrupts, `redirect()` / `notFound()`), so a static
    render that reaches the session is still handled by the framework
    rather than silently treated as signed out.
  * `paasCall()` is exported from the gateway as the compatibility name
    with the shell helper's exact semantics (`Unauthorized` without a
    session, `PaaS gateway call failed: <cmd>` on failure), so call sites
    switch with a one-line import change. The base admin actions
    (`app/actions/base/admin/{content,settings,system}.ts`) now import it
    from `@/app/services/base/platform-gateway`.
* New kernel modules under `src/services` (installed by the existing
  directory entry): `session.ts` (server-only; reads the session through
  the host shell's `app/lib/session.ts` seam, which auth_sdk overwrites
  with its NextAuth-backed copy, never through `app/(auth)`),
  `tenant-hosts.ts` (site-name normalisation, `sameSite`, the env map,
  the resolver hook) and `gateway-constants.ts` (`PLATFORM_GATEWAY_METHOD` /
  `PLATFORM_GATEWAY_PATH`, split out so the client-safe telemetry lane no
  longer imports the now server-only gateway; the gateway re-exports
  them). `index.ts` re-exports the new surface.
* `requires` drops `app/lib/paas-gateway.ts` and adds the
  `app/lib/session.ts` seam. telemetry_sdk and comms_sdk still import the
  shell helper; their switch is a separate change per SDK.

## 1.2.0

* Consolidates the paas-era Next.js shell chrome and admin settings/CMS
  surfaces that lived under the `RokctAI_frontend` shell into this kernel
  half as 32 flat templates in one top-level `installs` list, alongside
  the unchanged `src/services` kernel install.
  * Shell chrome: `components/custom/app-sidebar.tsx`,
    `components/custom/beta-toggle.tsx`, `components/custom/nav/nav-user.tsx`,
    `components/custom/nav/team-switcher.tsx`,
    `components/ui/date-range-picker.tsx`, `hooks/use-mobile.tsx`.
  * Admin surfaces: the admin home (`app/admin/page.tsx`),
    `components/custom/nav/admin-nav.tsx`, the content pages (`blogs`,
    `faqs`), the settings pages (`app`, `currencies`, `faqs`, `flutter`,
    `general`, `landing`, `pages`, `privacy`, `social`, `system`, `terms`),
    the system pages (`backup`, `info`, `languages`, `translations`,
    `update`) and the `content` / `settings` / `system` server actions at
    `app/actions/base/admin/`.
  * Manager surfaces: the manager shell `app/manager/layout.tsx` and
    home `app/manager/page.tsx`.
  * Customer surface: `components/custom/nav/client-nav.tsx`.
* Host paths drop the `paas` segment: `app/paas/admin/X` installs to
  `app/admin/X`, `app/paas/dashboard/X` to `app/manager/X`, and
  `app/actions/paas/admin/X` to `app/actions/base/admin/X`. Components and
  hooks keep their paths. Import specifiers and route strings were rewritten
  mechanically to match; file contents are otherwise unchanged.
* Templates are flat and installed through one top-level `installs` list;
  there are no `app_type` persona blocks. Admin and manager see similar
  pages and the page code hides what the other role should not see
  (Ray, 2026-09-03).
* `requires` lists the host-shell prerequisites the templates import but
  this SDK does not ship (`components/ui/*`, `app/lib/*`, `lib/utils`, the
  handson global-settings action, `app/config/platform`), the cross-SDK
  paths (`app/actions/telemetry/{admin/,}dashboard.ts` from telemetry_sdk,
  `app/actions/merchants/shop.ts` and `components/custom/nav/merchant-nav.tsx`
  from commerce/merchants) and `components/custom/nav/delivery-nav.tsx`,
  which has no SDK home yet; `_comment` names the owner of each.
* The three kernel files under `src/services` and their install entry are
  untouched.
