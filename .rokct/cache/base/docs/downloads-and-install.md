# Downloads, the install offer, the suffix in primary and Back to top

Three generic seams base_sdk 1.41.0 adds to the shell's chrome, and the
two rules 1.46.0 adds to the install offer (the browser's install prompt
as a real action; the offered platform's icon hidden). Base declares NO
entry, NO site name and NO colour for any of them: a home SDK hands the
data in, and a shell whose home SDK declares nothing renders exactly
what it rendered before.

## The site name's suffix in the primary colour

Ray, 2026-09-11 07:34:03Z: "also site name the .school get primary color
in nextjs".

The header's stem wordmark (`components/custom/header.tsx`,
`BrandStemWordmark`) shows a dotted platform name as its capitalised stem
followed by the rest of the name - the dot and the suffix. Since 1.41.0
that suffix span carries `text-primary`, the theme token every shell
already defines, and its own hook:

```tsx
<span data-brand-wordmark="tld" className="min-w-0 overflow-hidden text-primary">
  {suffix}
</span>
```

The stem span before it keeps `text-foreground`; the country-code span
beside the stem and the wordmark's own class list are untouched; the
slide the suffix makes when the header collapses is unchanged. A home SDK
that wants the suffix in another colour, weight or face styles
`[data-brand-wordmark="tld"]` with one rule, the way it styles
`[data-brand-wordmark="stem"]`.

The hero has the matching mode. `HeroConfig.brand` accepts `"stem-tld"`
beside `"name"` and `"stem"`:

| `brand`      | The hero's wordmark slot                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"name"`     | The host's own `Branding` component (the default).                  |
| `"stem"`     | The capitalised stem as text; the full name on aria-label and title. |
| `"stem-tld"` | The same stem, then the suffix in `text-primary` with the `tld` hook. |

A home SDK's hero copy declares `brand: "stem-tld"` the way it declares
`brand: "stem"` today; nothing else changes on its side.

`resolveHeroWordmark(brand, name)` (`landing/landing-page.ts`) answers
`{ text, name, suffix }` for `"stem-tld"` - the suffix is the trimmed
name after the stem, in its own case - and `{ text, name }` for `"stem"`
or for a name with no dot; `HeroWordmarkSlot` (`hero-view.tsx`) draws the
suffix after the stem inside the same span, so it shares the face and
the size, which is now computed over the stem and the suffix together.

## Footer downloads: one icon button per platform

Ray, 2026-09-11 07:34:37Z: "footer has  download links let them be
platform icons buttons".

`FooterChromeConfig` (`landing/footer-chrome-config.ts`) gains
`downloads?: DownloadEntry[]`:

```ts
export type DownloadPlatform =
  | "ios" | "android" | "huawei" | "macos" | "windows" | "linux" | "web";

export interface DownloadEntry {
  id: string;
  platform: DownloadPlatform;
  label: string;        // "Android app": the button's aria-label
  href: string;         // https URL, or a route of the shell's own
  external?: boolean;   // target _blank, rel noreferrer
  title?: string;       // the button's title when not the label
  mark?: BrandMarkId;   // googlePlay | appGallery | appStore | windows | chromeWebStore
}
```

`FooterChromeRow` (`components/custom/footer-chrome.tsx`) draws the
entries as `<nav aria-label="Downloads">` beside the link groups, above
the copyright line, through `DownloadButtons`
(`components/custom/download-buttons.tsx`, since 1.46.0 - see "The
offered platform's icon is hidden" below): one `<a>` per entry, 40px round, the theme's border,
transparent and tinted on hover
(`h-10 w-10 rounded-full border border-border bg-transparent hover:bg-muted flex items-center justify-center`),
the label as `aria-label` and `title`, the platform on
`data-download-platform`. Inside it: the mark the entry names, from
`BRAND_MARKS` through `next/image` with `markImageClass` (so the two
monochrome marks invert on the dark shell, as everywhere else), or - with
no mark named - a neutral glyph from `landing/platform-glyphs.tsx`: a
phone (ios, android, huawei), a laptop (macos, windows), a terminal
(linux) or a globe (web), stroked in `currentColor`. No third-party mark
is ever drawn by hand.

`landing/download-platform.ts` holds the pure rules: `DOWNLOAD_PLATFORMS`,
`isDownloadPlatform`, `isDownloadHref` (`https:` with a host, or a path
with one leading slash), `isDownloadEntry`, `normaliseDownloads` (the
drawable entries in declared order, the first of two with the same `id`)
and `downloadTitle`. Nothing declared, or nothing drawable, draws no nav.

`FooterChromeLabels.downloads` ("Downloads") is the nav's accessible
name; override it with the other words.

## The install offer: the app for the visitor's platform

Ray, 2026-09-11 07:37:17Z: "this nextjs has install, it does show on
mobile though i havent seen it in desktop i think it installs as pwa but
i think it should check the platform and offer app of that platform".

`components/custom/install-offer.tsx` (`"use client"`) exports
`InstallOffer({ downloads, labels?, platform?, className? })`:

1. It renders NOTHING on the server and on the first client render.
2. After mount it reads `matchMedia("(display-mode: standalone)")` - an
   installed page gets no offer - and the visitor's platform
   (`landing/install-offer.ts` `detectPlatform()`:
   `navigator.userAgentData.platform` first, then the user-agent string:
   iPhone/iPad to `ios`, HarmonyOS/HUAWEI to `huawei`, Android to
   `android`, Windows to `windows`, Mac to `macos`, Linux/X11 to
   `linux`; nothing recognised is `null`).
3. `pickDownload(downloads, platform)` takes the first entry for the
   platform, with `android` falling back to `huawei` and `huawei` to
   `android` (`DOWNLOAD_FALLBACKS`); the desktops and iOS take only their
   own; `web` and `null` take none.
4. With an entry it draws one icon button and "Get the <label>" (the
   entry's label; `labels.get` overrides the prefix) linking there.
5. Beside it - whether or not an entry matched - it draws "Install"
   (`labels.install`) once the browser has fired `beforeinstallprompt`;
   a click runs that prompt (below).
6. With neither it draws nothing.

### The install prompt is a real action (1.46.0)

Ray, 2026-09-11 20:35:38Z: "nextjs no longer offering me to install app
like it used to with pwa"; 20:46:43Z: "the install offer used to show
its not showing, that bottom offer is not really an offer its attention,
no clicking icon on browser and it try to install or it popup and
install".

The 1.41.0 offer listened for `beforeinstallprompt` only when no entry
matched the platform, and only from a second effect after the platform
read: a shell with a matching entry never offered the install, and
elsewhere an early event was missed while a late one was swallowed by
`preventDefault()` with nothing drawn for it. Since 1.46.0:

1. The FIRST effect on mount - before any platform read - listens for
   `beforeinstallprompt` and `appinstalled`, once. The event is stashed
   and stays stashed until the visitor acts; `appinstalled` drops it.
2. `preventDefault()` runs only when the Install control will render. A
   page running installed (`display-mode: standalone`) leaves the
   browser's own banner alone.
3. The Install control renders only once an event is stashed. A click
   calls `event.prompt()`, awaits `event.userChoice`, then clears the
   stash; a second click while the prompt shows is ignored, and a later
   event (the browser may fire one again after a dismissal) is stashed
   again.
4. The native link and the Install action render side by side when both
   apply.

`BeforeInstallPromptEvent` is exported for a host that types the event
itself. Base registers no service worker: the browser fires the event
only for a page it finds installable, which needs the host's own
`app/manifest.ts` to carry `icons`.

### The offered platform's icon is hidden (1.46.0)

Ray, 2026-09-11 20:33:16Z, of the icon buttons: "they become double when
you tell user to download for that platform, i think should hide the
normal one when showing the other".

The offer publishes the id of the entry it is showing to
`OFFERED_DOWNLOAD` (`landing/install-offer.ts`;
`createOfferedDownloadStore()` is a plain `get`/`set`/`subscribe` store,
`null` until set, notifying on a change only) after mount, and clears
it on unmount. `DownloadButtons({ downloads, hideOffered? })`
(`components/custom/download-buttons.tsx`, `"use client"`) reads it
through `React.useSyncExternalStore` with `null` as the server snapshot
and draws `visibleDownloads(downloads, offeredId)` - every entry but
that id, in declared order; `null` or an id no entry carries keeps them
all. So the server HTML and the first client render carry EVERY icon -
no window read at render - and the duplicate goes after mount; with no
offer mounted, no platform recognised or an installed page nothing is
hidden. `hideOffered={false}` keeps every button; `useOfferedDownload()`
is exported for a home SDK's own row.

`platform` forces the platform for a preview or a test. `FooterChromeRow`
mounts the offer FIRST in the Downloads nav (`installOffer` prop, default
`true`); a home SDK that wants it in a header slot imports it from
`@/components/custom/install-offer` with the same `downloads` and passes
`installOffer={false}` to the row. Base changes no header by default.

## Declaring the entries

A home SDK spreads the entries into the config its footer hands the row:

```ts
import { FooterChromeRow } from "@/components/custom/footer-chrome";
import { FOOTER_CHROME_CONFIG } from "@/components/custom/landing/footer-chrome-config";

<FooterChromeRow
  config={{
    ...FOOTER_CHROME_CONFIG,
    downloads: [
      { id: "android", platform: "android", label: "Android app", href: "/get/android", mark: "googlePlay" },
      { id: "web", platform: "web", label: "Web app", href: "/app" },
    ],
  }}
/>
```

Every word, link and mark there is the home SDK's; the hrefs above are
routes so this page names no host.

## The floating "Back to top" button

Ray, 2026-09-11 12:32Z: "whats missing is floating push to home, that
button you press and it get you to top i just forgot what it says".

`components/custom/back-to-top.tsx` (`"use client"`) exports
`BackToTop({ threshold?, label?, className? })`, and
`components/custom/landing-content.tsx` mounts it once, after `<main>`,
so every composed landing - a base-only host and a home SDK's, whose `/`
sends an anonymous visitor to `/landing` - has it with no host edit:

1. Hidden at the top of the page; shown once the visitor has scrolled
   past `threshold` pixels - one viewport height by default, read on
   every check (`landing/back-to-top.ts` `resolveThreshold`,
   `isPastThreshold`: strictly past, so the top is always hidden).
2. Fixed at the bottom right (`bottom-4 right-4`, `md:bottom-6
   md:right-6`, the safe-area inset as margin) at `z-30`: under the
   sticky header (`z-50`) and its mobile panel (`z-40`), so an open menu
   covers it, and clear of the left edge and the vertical middle a home
   SDK's floating nav uses. The install offer above is inline in the
   footer's Downloads nav, never fixed, so the two never meet.
3. A click scrolls to the top - `"smooth"`, or `"auto"` (the instant
   jump) when `(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` matches
   (`scrollBehaviour`) - and blurs the button, which hides again.
4. The scroll and resize listeners are passive and folded into one
   `requestAnimationFrame` per frame; every window read is in the effect
   or the click, so the server and the first client render agree.
5. Always in the tree and fading (`motion-safe:transition-opacity`);
   while hidden it carries `tabIndex={-1}`, `aria-hidden` and
   `pointer-events-none`. Shown, it is a keyboard-focusable `<button>`
   with `aria-label` and `title` "Back to top" (`BACK_TO_TOP_LABEL`;
   `label` overrides).

Lucide's `ArrowUp` is the icon; the classes are theme tokens only
(`bg-background`, `border-border`, `text-primary`, `hover:bg-muted`,
`ring-ring`). A host that wants the button on every page mounts
`<BackToTop />` from `@/components/custom/back-to-top` in its own root
layout; `className` adds to the button, `threshold` sets the distance.

## Tests

`tests/download-platform.test.mts`, `tests/install-offer.test.mts`
(since 1.46.0 also `visibleDownloads` and the store) and
`tests/back-to-top.test.mts` (node) execute the rules; `tests/test_manifest.py` holds the header's
suffix span, the hero mode, the seam's shape, the row's nav and button,
the component's contract, the 1.46.0 early attach, guarded
`preventDefault`, `prompt()` then `userChoice`, the publish and the
row's server snapshot, and the installs.
