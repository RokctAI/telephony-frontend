/**
 * Host-owned platform constants seam. Named in auth_sdk's manifest
 * `requires`; read by its `components/custom/auth-form.tsx`
 * (`PLATFORM_NAME`, `VOUCHER_OFFSET_Y`) and re-exported wholesale by
 * `app/config/platform.ts`, the way RokctAI/rokctai_frontend's copy is.
 *
 * Deliberately NEUTRAL. `PLATFORM_NAME` is the PLATFORM's wordmark, the
 * same value rokctai_frontend's copy of this file carries: Ray,
 * 2026-09-09, the telephony shell takes "the hosting shape: a
 * telephony_sdk landing half selling the Telephony plan category on
 * control", a storefront on the control site, so the header and hero
 * wordmark base_sdk renders through `components/custom/branding.tsx` is
 * the platform's, not a product's. Everything the PRODUCT is called - the
 * <title>, the site name, the description, the cards - is the home SDK's
 * (telephony_sdk's `components/custom/landing/telephony-site-metadata.ts`,
 * registered into base_sdk's site-metadata registry at compose time; its
 * siteName "Rokct Telephony" is a placeholder that SDK flags, no source
 * names the product). No product copy lives in this shell.
 *
 * The layout numbers keep rokctai_frontend's values: nothing in this shell
 * renders the country superscript they position (the neutral branding
 * prints the plain wordmark), so they are here only so SDK code that
 * imports them by name resolves.
