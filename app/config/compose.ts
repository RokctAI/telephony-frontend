// Compose-time SDK flags for the shell.

// Entries between the markers below are injected by the Rokct SDK installer
// (sdk_installer_base.py update_integrations()) — the same contract as the
// registries base_sdk installs under components/custom/landing/. Each
// installed SDK's manifest declares a `<flag>: true,` line that is inserted
// on a new line immediately after the start marker. Do not remove or
// reformat the marker comments inside the object literal.

// The chat surface ships in the agent SDK, so the bare shell defaults to
// hands-on mode. This shell's registry template (telephony.json) composes NO
// agent_sdk on purpose - its integrations are unconditional and would flip
// the storefront AI-first - so the flag stays false here.
export const AI_FIRST = sdkFlags.agent ?? false;
